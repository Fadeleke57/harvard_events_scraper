In this talk, we'll describe some recent results in the Schubert calculus of Springer fibers. Given a nilpotent linear operator $X$, the Springer fiber of $X$ is the subvariety of flags that are fixed by $X$ in the sense that $XV_i \\subseteq V_i$ for all $i$. The top-dimensional cohomology of Springer fibers admits a representation of the symmetric group first discovered by Tonny Springer as the seminal example of a geometric representation. Where classical Schubert calculus describes geometry governed by permutations, that of Springer fibers incorporates the combinatorics both of permutations and of partitions. We'll describe new results about this geometry in more detail, including evidence that from a geometric and topological perspective, the best combinatorial model for Springer fibers comes from representation-theoretic objects called webs.\nFor more information, please see \nhttps://researchseminars.org/seminar/harvard-mit-ag-seminar", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/algebraic-geometry-in-string-theory-seminar-species-scale-across-string-moduli-spaces-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

For the uniform distribution on independent sets of a given size $k$ in a graph, perhaps the most natural Markov chain is the so-called ``down-up walk''. The down-up walk, which essentially goes back to the foundational work of Metropolis, Rosenbluth, Rosenbluth, Teller and Teller on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, starts at an arbitrary independent set of size $k$, and in every step, removes an element uniformly at random and adds a uniformly random legal choice.\nDavies and Perkins showed that there is a critical $k = \\alpha(\\Delta)n$ such that it is hard to (approximately) sample from the uniform distribution on independent sets for the class of graphs $G$ with $n$ vertices and maximum degree at most $\\Delta$. They conjectured that for $k$ below this critical value, the down-up walk mixes in polynomial time.

On the one hand, TBG hosts flat topological Landau-level-like bands which realize quantum anomalous Hall states and orbital ferromagnetism under the right conditions. On the other hand, these bands are characterized by concentrated charge density and show experimental signs of fluctuating magnetism, and unconventional superconductivty; all characteristics of Hubbard-model-like physics. The emergence of fluctuating moments is particularly surprising, as localized Wannier states do not exist in topological bands. I will discuss a phenomenological model for the flat bands in TBG that centers the concentration of charge density and, relatedly, the concentration of Berry flux. The bands obtained have excellent quantitative agreement with the Bistritzer-Macdonald model for realistic parameters. I will show that, rather remarkably, the model hosts decoupled flavor moments which despite being only power-law delocalized with infinite localization length, have parametrically small overlap with each other. I will show how this unifies many of the observations in TBG and leads to a novel Mott semimetal phase for intermediate temperatures where moments are thermally disordered but charge fluctuations are mostly frozen.\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126\nPassword: cmsa", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/special-lecture-from-triangles-to-algebraic-geometry-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

At short distances, scattering in QCD can be evaluated in perturbation theory and leads to highly intricate, multivariate mathematical functions such as generalized polylogarithms. To gain further insight, one can study a cousin of QCD called planar N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. Some processes in this theory can be computed to eighth order in perturbation theory, versus second or third order in QCD. The computation and analysis of these results rely on a Hopf algebra coaction on polylogarithms. Its maximal iteration is called the `symbol', which serves as a `genetic code' for amplitudes. The symbol is a linear combination of words, sequences of letters analogous to sequences of DNA base pairs. Understanding the alphabet, and then reading the code, exposes the physics and mathematics of quantum scattering, including bizarre new symmetries. For example, the two scattering amplitudes that are known to the highest orders in perturbation theory (8 loops) are related to each other by an `antipodal duality', which involves reading the code backwards as well as forwards. A third scattering amplitude, which contains the other two as limits, has an antipodal self-duality which `explains' the other duality.

As a joint work in progress with Jesse Kass and Matthew Satriano, I will describe moduli spaces of curves with m-fold singularities (with topological constraints) and describe how far the Torelli map extends over such spaces into the Alexeev compactifications.\nFor more information, please see \nhttps://researchseminars.org/seminar/harvard-mit-ag-seminar", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/algebraic-geometry-in-string-theory-seminar-species-scale-across-string-moduli-spaces-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

Amplifying an elastic wave as it passes through the material is a prominent example, with potential applications in acoustic signal processing and loss mitigation. The fundamental mechanism for signal amplification of this kind is the parametric amplifier--an oscillator whose stiffness is periodically modulated in time, which can inject energy into mechanical oscillations. Typically, parametric amplification occurs at distinct modulation frequencies that are trivially related to the resonance modes of the unmodulated system, which restricts its utility for amplifying signals with complex spatial or spectral structure. In this talk, I'll show how spatial variation of the modulation phase in parametric oscillator networks enables amplification phenomena that are far richer than those achievable by uncoupled and uncoordinated parametric amplifiers. Examples include turning off parametric resonances for particular vibrational modes in small assemblies [1], and achieving nonreciprocal broadband amplification in periodic arrays [2]. The existence of parametric resonances is tied to the internal symmetries inherent to mechanical systems as well as the symmetries obeyed by the parametric variation in space and time, through an exact theoretical framework that augments the standard Floquet analysis of space-time modulated systems.\nThis seminar will be held in person and on Zoom.\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/96657833341\nPassword: cmsa", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-interacting-active-matter-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

Numerical approximations with sufficient precision of the entries of this matrix, called periods, allow to recover some algebraic invariants of the variety, such as the Néron-Severi group in the case of surfaces.

Of note, it is a folklore conjecture that, when all elliptic curves \nE/K\n are ordered by a suitably defined height, the average value of their ranks is exactly 1/2. One fruitful avenue for understanding the distribution of \nE(K)\n has been to first understand the distribution of the sizes of Selmer groups of elliptic curves. In this direction, various authors (including Bhargava-Shankar, Poonen-Rains, and Bhargava-Kane-Lenstra-Poonen-Rains) have made conjectures which predict, for example, that the average size of the \nn\n-Selmer group of \nE/K\n is equal to the sum of the divisors of \nn\n.

Bruhat interval subdivisions in general correspond to cones in the positive tropical flag variety by a combination of results of Joswig-Loho-Luber-Olarte and Boretsky; the subdivisions indexed by Coxeter elements are finest subdivisions and so correspond to a subset of the maximal cones. For a particular choice of Coxeter element, we recover a cubical subdivision of the permutahedron due to Harada-Horiguchi-Masuda-Park.

We extend this notion to (−1)-form U(1) symmetries. The spontaneous breaking is diagnosed by a dependence of the vacuum energy on constant background field θ, which can be probed by the topological susceptibility. This leads to a reinterpretation of the Strong CP problem as arising from a spontaneously broken instantonic symmetry in QCD. We discuss how known solutions to the problem are unified in this framework and explore some, so far unsuccessful, attempts to find new solutions.

Please note special time and location.\nRecently, there has been much progress in understanding stationary measures for colored (also called multi-species or multi-type) interacting particle systems, motivated by asymptotic phenomena and rich underlying algebraic and combinatorial structures (such as nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials).\nIn this work, we present a unified approach to constructing stationary measures for several colored particle systems on the ring and the line, including (1) the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (mASEP); (2) the q-deformed Totally Asymmetric Zero Range Process (TAZRP) also known as the q-Boson particle system; (3) the q-deformed Pushing Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (q-PushTASEP). Our method is based on integrable stochastic vertex models and the Yang--Baxter equation. We express the stationary measures as partition functions of new ``queue vertex models'' on the cylinder. The stationarity property is a direct consequence of the Yang--Baxter equation. This is joint work with A. Aggarwal and L.

Questions about when a graph embeds in or decomposes another are central in combinatorics. ``Dirac-type'' embedding results address minimum-degree conditions to ensure an embedding of some graph. Block designs, a fundamental object of Design Theory, are decompositions of complete graphs.\nIn this talk, we will discuss robustness of embeddings and decompositions. For example, given a hypergraph of large minimum degree, we will discuss the threshold for a random subhypergraph to have a perfect matching or Hamilton cycle. We will also discuss the threshold for constructing block designs using only a random selection of blocks. All of these results utilize the recent Park--Pham Theorem or one of its variants.

Surprisingly, some of its symmetries have only been properly understood in the last couple of years. Specifically, such theories typically have a very rich set of symmetries, involving modern notions such as higher-form symmetries, higher-group symmetries, and categorical symmetries. A proper understanding of these generalized symmetries is not really crucial if we are interested in scattering processes involving fundamental particles only, but it does become quite essential if we want to add monopoles into the mix.  In this talk I will review where these generalized symmetries come from, and how they impose\n\nconstraints on scattering amplitudes of elementary particles against heavy monopoles. This will allow us to resolve a decades-old puzzle concerning such processes, where incoming electrons appear to become fractional particles after the scattering event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126\n\n\n\n\nPassword: cmsa\n\n\n--------\n\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA Quantum Matter and other seminar videos\n\n(more to be uploaded):\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0NRmB0fnLJQAnYwkpt9PN2PBKx4rvdup\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA seminar mailing list:\n\n\nhttps://forms.gle/1ewa7KeP6BxBuBeRA", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-interacting-active-matter-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

The free energy of the spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SSK) model, for example, has Gaussian fluctuations at high temperature, but Tracy-Widom fluctuations at low temperature. A similar phenomenon holds for the bipartite SSK model, and we show that, when the temperature is within a small window around the critical temperature, the free energy fluctuations converge to an independent sum of Gaussian and Tracy-Widom random variables (joint work with Han Le). Our work follows two recent papers that proved similar results for the SSK model (by Landon and by Johnstone, Klochkov, Onatski, Pavlyshyn). Analyzing bipartite SSK at critical temperature requires a variety of tools including classical random matrix results, contour integral techniques, and a CLT for the log-characteristic polynomial of Laguerre (Wishart) random matrices evaluated near the spectral edge. This last ingredient was not present in the literature when we began our project, so I will discuss our proof of this CLT, which has other applications separate from bipartite spin glasses.\nThis seminar will take place on Zoom.\nZoom link:\n \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/98500892109", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/probability-seminar-fractal-geometry-of-stochastic-partial-differential-equations-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

Most physically interesting scenarios demand control of the point-wise behavior of the solution. Unfortunately, most times this level of regularity is notoriously difficult to obtain for non-linear equations. In this talk, I will discuss very low regularity solutions namely distributional (or weak) solutions of vacuum Einsten's equations in 3+1 dimensions.

Osthus-Promel-Taraz extended this result to much lower densities: when m >(\\sqrt{3}/4 +eps) n^{3/2} \\sqrt{\\log n}, a typical triangle-free graph with m edges is a random subgraph of size m from a nearly balanced complete bipartite graph (and this no longer holds below this threshold). What do typical triangle-free graphs at sparser densities look like and how many of them are there? We consider what we call the \"ordered\" regime, in which typical triangle-free graphs are not bipartite but do align closely with a nearly balanced bipartition. In this regime we prove asymptotic formulas for the number of triangle-free graphs and give a precise probabilistic description of their structure.

However, the overhead in the realization of error-corrected “logical” qubits, where information is encoded across many physical qubits for redundancy, poses significant challenges to large-scale logical quantum computing. In this talk we will discuss recent advances in quantum information processing using dynamically reconfigurable arrays of neutral atoms. With this platform we have realized programmable quantum processing with encoded logical qubits, combining the use of 280 physical qubits, high two-qubit gate fidelities, arbitrary connectivity, and mid-circuit readout. Using this logical processor with various types of error-correcting codes, we demonstrate that we can improve logical two-qubit gates by increasing code size, outperform physical qubit fidelities, create logical GHZ states, and perform computationally complex scrambling circuits using 48 logical qubits and hundreds of logical gates. We find that this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with error detection, outperforming physical qubits at both benchmarking and quantum simulations. These results herald the advent of early errorcorrected quantum computation, enabling new applications and inspiring a shift in both the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead.\n*In-person and on Zoom*\nQR Code & Link:\n\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/779283357?pwd=MitXVm1pYUlJVzZqT3lwV2pCT1ZUQT09\n\nPasscode: 657361\n\n\nhttps://mathpicture.fas.harvard.edu/seminar", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/mathematical-picture-language-seminar-inverse-theorems-and-approximate-structure-2-2/"},

In 1966, Erdős conjectured that $d$-degenerate bipartite graphs have Turán number $O(n^{2-1/d})$. Though this is still far from solved, the bound $O(n^{2-1/4d})$ was proved by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov in 2003. In a similar vein, the Burr--Erdős conjecture states that graphs of bounded degeneracy have Ramsey number linear in their number of vertices. (This is in contrast to general graphs whose Ramsey number can be as large as exponential in the number of vertices.) This conjecture was proved in a breakthrough work of Lee in 2017.In this talk, we investigate the hypergraph analogues of these two questions. Though the typical notion of hypergraph degeneracy does not give any information about either the Ramsey or Turán numbers of hypergraphs, we instead define a notion that we call skeletal degeneracy. We prove the hypergraph analogue of the Burr--Erdős conjecture: hypergraphs of bounded skeletal degeneracy have Ramsey number linear in their number of vertices. Furthermore, we give good bounds on the Turán number of partite hypergraphs in terms of their skeletal degeneracy.

To this end, I will first show that there exist non-invertible chiral symmetries acting on quark fields once the SM is extended with gauged quark flavor symmetry. Interestingly enough, such symmetries, which we named them as \"non-invertible Peccei-Quinn symmetries\", exist only because the SM has the same number of generations as colors, yet another feature that deserves a fundamental explanation. Then I discuss how these new generalized symmetries set the down Yukawa to be exactly zero and lead to a massless quark solution to the strong CP problem. Completion of the solution requires (i) generation of down quark Yukawas to be consistent with both observed quark mass spectrum and mixings and (ii) generation of O(1) CP violating phase called CKM phase, crucially without destabilizing our solution to the strong CP problem. I will discuss that these rather non-trivial tasks can be achieved by a UV completion in an SU(9) quark color-flavor unification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA Quantum Matter and other seminar videos\n\n(more to be uploaded):\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0NRmB0fnLJQAnYwkpt9PN2PBKx4rvdup\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA seminar mailing list:\n\n\nhttps://forms.gle/1ewa7KeP6BxBuBeRA", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-interacting-active-matter-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2/"},

Certifying that an n-qubit state in the experimental lab is close to a highly-entangled target state typically requires deep entangling circuits or exponentially many single-qubit measurements. In this work, we prove that almost all n-qubit target states, including those with exponential circuit complexity, can be certified from only O(n^2) single-qubit measurements. This result is established by a new technique relating certification to a random walk's mixing time. Our protocol has applications for benchmarking the fidelity of quantum systems and for learning and verifying neural networks, tensor networks, and various other representations of quantum states using only single-qubit measurements. We show that such verified representations can be used to efficiently predict highly non-local properties that would otherwise require an exponential number of measurements.\n*In-person and on Zoom*\nQR Code & Link:\n\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/779283357?pwd=MitXVm1pYUlJVzZqT3lwV2pCT1ZUQT09\n\nPasscode: 657361\n\n\nhttps://mathpicture.fas.harvard.edu/seminar", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/mathematical-picture-language-seminar-inverse-theorems-and-approximate-structure-2/"},

One possible answer, proposed in the PhD thesis of Kennedy-Hunt, comes from an object called the logarithmic Hilbert scheme. I will give an introduction to this circle of these ideas, explain the basic geometric properties of the logarithmic Hilbert scheme, and sketch connections with certain moduli spaces of higher dimensional varieties.

Such non-existence results are often the starting point for inductive arguments. For example, Minkowski’s theorem that there are no unramified extensions of Q can be used to prove the Kronecker-Weber theorem, and the vanishing of a certain space of modular forms is the starting point for Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. In this talk, I will begin by describing many such vanishing results both in arithmetic and in the theory of automorphic forms, and how they are related by the Langlands program (sometimes only conjecturally).

The correctness of new units of knowledge depends not only on the correctness of the new reasoning, but also on the correctness of old units that the new one builds on. If left unchecked, errors could completely ruin the validity of most of this knowledge so there must some error-correcting going on. What are the error-corrections processes employed in nature and how effective are they? In this talk, we describe our attempts to model such phenomena using probablistic models - we describe models for growth of cumulative knowledge, emergence of errors and methods to check for errors and eliminate them. We then analyze in this compound model, when effects of errors may survive, and when they are totally eliminated.\nThe central discovery in our work is the following optimistic statement: If we do checking correctly (most of the time) investing just a constant factor (<1) of our effort in checking (and saving the remaining constant factor towards deriving new units of knowledge), then effects of errors can be kept in check. Notably the amount of effort expended on checking does not scale with the volume of total knowledge or the depth of dependencies in the new units of knowledge, either of which would be overwhelming.\nBased on the papers:\nIs this correct?

I will present a gauge-invariant definition of Love numbers and show how to extract them in a coordinate-independent way from scattering amplitudes of the gravitational Raman process. I will show that the worldline EFT exhibits strong fine-tuning when applied to black holes. This gives rise to a naturalness paradox associated with the vanishing of black hole static Love numbers. In the second part of my talk, I will present a new symmetry of black holes (Love symmetry) that elegantly resolves this paradox. The Love symmetry is tightly connected to isometries of extremal black holes that appear in many holographic constructions.

The conference will center on the amplituhedron—the first and major example of a positive geometry. Building on the work of Lusztig and Postnikov on the positive Grassmannian, the physicists Arkani-Hamed and Trnka introduced the amplituhedron in 2013 as a geometric object that “explains” the so-called BCFW recurrence for scattering amplitudes in N = 4 super Yang Mills theory (SYM). Simultaneously, cluster algebras, originally introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky to study total positivity, have been revealed to have a crucial role in describing singularities of N = 4 SYM scattering amplitudes. Thus, one can use ideas from quantum field theory (QFT) to connect cluster algebras to positive geometries, and in particular to the amplituhedron. Additionally, QFT can also be used to discover new examples of positive geometries. The conference will bring together a wide range of mathematicians and physicists both to draw new connections within algebraic combinatorics and geometry and to advance our physical understanding of scattering amplitudes and QFT.\nThe conference features: Introductory Lectures, an Open Problems Forum, Emerging Scholars Talks, and talks by experts in the fields.\nSee the detailed schedule on the \nconference webpage.\nDirections to CMSA\nRegister Online for in-person talks\nRegister for Zoom Meeting\nConfirmed Speakers:\nOrganizers:\nThis event will be co-funded by the National Science Foundation.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/symmetry-colloquia-global-categorical-symmetries-particle-soliton-degeneracies-from-spontaneously-broken-non-invertible-symmetry-2-2-2/"},

We establish the commutation relations for its generators and study the large N limit of its representation. We show that the large N limit algebra is isomorphic to the uniform in N algebra studied by Costello, which is conjecturally isomorphic to the deformed double current algebra studied by Guay. Under appropriate scaling limit, we show that the large N limit algebra degenerates to a Lie algebra which admits a surjective map to the affine Lie algebra of u(p). This leads to a complete proof of the large N emergence of the u(p) current algebra as proposed by Dorey, Tong and Turner. This also suggests a rigorous derivation of edge excitation of a fractional quantum Hall droplet.

Our method is based on integrable stochastic vertex models and the Yang--Baxter equation. We express the stationary measures as partition functions of new ``queue vertex models'' on the cylinder.

W. Ma - Northeastern University", "text": "The discovery of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states started a new chapter in modern physics. Nowadays, more than 70 FQH states at different filling factors have been observed. Among them, the FQH state at the filling factor ν=5/2 in GaAs (or the 5/2 state) remains one of the most special and attractive states. Since its discovery in 1987, different possible topological orders have been proposed to describe the 5/2 state. Some of them can host an exotic type of particles, known as non-Abelian anyons. Recent experiments have provided more insights into the understanding of the 5/2 state, but its underlying nature is still under debate.\nIn this talk, I will review the basics of the 5/2 state [1] and a more unified theoretical description of different possible topological orders of the 5/2 state that we have recently proposed [2]. I will also review the groundbreaking thermal Hall conductance experiment [3] and the follow-up quantum Hall interface experiments by the Weizmann Institute group [4, 5], and discuss what possible lessons that we can learn from the experimental results. Lastly, I will talk about some possible directions and related topics for future investigations.\nReferences:\n[1] K. K. W. Ma, M. R. Peterson, V. W. Scarola, and K.

Then, we discuss universality of max-margin classification. In particular, we characterize the prediction accuracy of the non-linear random features model, a two-layer neural network with random first layer weights. The spectrum of the kernel random matrices plays a crucial role in the analysis.

The biophysical dynamics and spectral evolution of nuclear wrinkling during multicellular development remain poorly understood due to a lack of direct quantitative measurements. We characterize the onset and dynamics of nuclear wrinkling during egg development in the fruit fly when nurse cell nuclei increase in size and display stereotypical wrinkling behaviour. A spectral analysis of three-dimensional high-resolution live-imaging data from several hundred nuclei reveals a robust asymptotic power-law scaling of angular fluctuations consistent with renormalization and scaling predictions from a nonlinear elastic shell model. We further demonstrate that nuclear wrinkling can be reversed through osmotic shock and suppressed by microtubule disruption, providing tunable physical and biological control parameters for probing the mechanical properties of the nuclear envelope, highlighting in passing the importance of nonlinear response to biological robustness.\nThis seminar will be held in person and on Zoom.\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/96657833341\nPassword: cmsa", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-interacting-active-matter-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2/"},

Tachikawa to study anomaly in heterotic string theory via homotopy theory, especially the theory of Topological Modular Forms (TMF). TMF is an E-infinity ring spectrum which is conjectured by Stolz-Teichner to classify two-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theories in physics. In the previous work (https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13542), we proved the vanishing of anomalies in heterotic string theory mathematically by using TMF.\nFurthermore, we have a recent update (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06196) on the previous work. Because of the vanishing result, we can consider a secondary transformation of spectra, which is shown to coincide with the Anderson self-duality morphism of TMF. This allows us to detect subtle torsion phenomena in TMF by differential-geometric ways, and leads us to new conjectures on the relation between VOAs and TMF.\nThis seminar will be held in person and on Zoom: https://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126\nPassword: cmsa", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-interacting-active-matter-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

A textbook example of this is the actomyosin contractile ring that forms during cell division. Recent evidence, however, has begun to suggest alternate or redundant mechanisms that do not depend on myosin. Experiments on simplified, reconstituted systems also point to contractility and structure formation in disordered, apolar arrays of filaments. We propose a motor-free mechanism that can generate contraction in biopolymer networks without the need for motors such as myosin or polar filaments such as actin. This mechanism is based on active binding and unbinding of cross-linkers that breaks the principle of detailed balance, together with the asymmetric force-extension response of semiflexible biopolymers. We discuss the resulting force-velocity relation and other implications of this, as well as possible evidence for non-motor force generation.\nThis seminar will be held in person and on Zoom.\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/96657833341\nPassword: cmsa", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-interacting-active-matter-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2/"},

Gauged Linear Sigma Models (GLSMs) serve as a means of interpolating between Kahler geometry and singularity theory. In enumerative geometry, they should specialize to both Gromov-Witten and Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten theory. In joint work with Bumsig Kim (see arXiv:2006.12182), we constructed such enumerative invariants for GLSMs. Furthermore, we proved that these invariants form a Cohomological Field Theory. In this lecture, I will describe GLSMs and Cohomological Field Theories, review the history of their development in enumerative geometry, and discuss the construction of these general invariants. Briefly, the invariants are obtained by forming the analogue of a virtual fundamental class which lives in the twisted Hodge complex over a certain \"moduli space of maps to the GLSM\". This virtual fundamental class roughly comes as the Atiyah class of a \"virtual matrix factorization\" associated to the GLSM data.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/algebraic-geometry-in-string-theory-seminar-species-scale-across-string-moduli-spaces-3-2-2/"},

The main result of the talk is that almost every dynamically syndetic set is multiplicatively very rich: it is “thick” in some coset of a multiplicative subsemigroup. We will discuss some applications: a “thick-starters” van der Waerden theorem; the existence of multiplicative structure in sets of the form A – A + t; and the topological disjointness of minimal niltranslations and minimal, aperiodic multiplicative actions.

Jiang - University of Cambridge, Dept. of Computer Science", "text": "There is much excitement about the opportunity to harness the power of large language models (LLMs) when building problem-solving assistants. However, the standard methodology of evaluating LLMs based on static pairs of inputs and outputs is insufficient to be able to make an informed decision about which LLMs, and under what assistive settings they can be sensibly utilised. Static assessment fails to take into account the essential interactive element in their deployment, and therefore limits how we understand language model capabilities. In this talk, we present our recent work introducing CheckMate, an adaptable prototype platform for humans to interact with and evaluate LLMs. We discuss our study with CheckMate to evaluate three language models (InstructGPT, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) as assistants in proving undergraduate-level mathematics, with a mixed cohort of participants from undergraduate students to professors of mathematics. We release the resulting interaction and rating dataset, MathConverse. By analysing MathConverse, we derive a taxonomy of human behaviours and uncover that despite a generally positive correlation, there are notable instances of divergence between correctness and perceived helpfulness in LLM generations, amongst other findings. Further, we identify useful scenarios and existing issues of GPT-4 in mathematical reasoning through a series of case studies contributed by expert mathematicians. We conclude with actionable takeaways for ML practitioners and mathematicians: models which communicate uncertainty, respond well to user corrections, and are more interpretable and concise may constitute better assistants; interactive evaluation is a promising way to navigate the capability of these models; humans should be aware of language models’ algebraic fallibility and discern where they are appropriate to use.\n \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/95706757940?pwd=dHhMeXBtd1BhN0RuTWNQR0xEVzJkdz09\n\nPassword: cmsa", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-new-technologies-in-mathematics-seminar-evaluating-language-models-for-mathematics-through-interactions/"},

The exact mechanism that these models use during forward passes is an interesting area of study. This talk studies two interesting phenomena.In\n\nthe first half, we explore how and why pre-trained language models, specifically BERT of moderate sizes, can effectively learn linguistic structures like parse trees during pre-training. Specifically, using synthetic data through PCFGs, we show how moderate-sized transformers can perform forward-backward parsing, also known as the inside-outside algorithm, during inference. We further understand the role of the pre-training loss for the model to learn to parse during pre-training.\nIn the second half, we consider in-context learning of large language models, where they learn to reason on the fly. An ongoing hypothesis is that transformers simulate gradient descent at inference to perform in-context learning. We propose the Transformer in Transformer (TinT) framework, which creates explicit transformer architectures that can simulate and fine-tune a small pre-trained transformer model during inference. E.g. a 1.3B parameter TINT model can simulate and fine-tune a 125 million parameter model in a single forward pass. This framework suggests that large transformers might execute intricate sub-routines during inference, and provides insights for enhancing their capabilities through intelligent design considerations.\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/95706757940?pwd=dHhMeXBtd1BhN0RuTWNQR0xEVzJkdz09\n\nPassword: cmsa", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-new-technologies-in-mathematics-seminar-evaluating-language-models-for-mathematics-through-interactions-2-2-2-2/"},

The p-biased product measure of F increases as p increases from 0 to 1, and often exhibits a drastic change around a specific value, which is called a \"threshold.\" Thresholds of increasing families have been of great historical interest and a central focus of the study of random discrete structures (e.g. random graphs and hypergraphs), with estimation of thresholds for specific properties the subject of some of the most challenging work in the area. In 2006, Jeff Kahn and Gil Kalai conjectured that a natural (and often easy to calculate) lower bound q(F) (which we refer to as the “expectation-threshold”) for the threshold is in fact never far from its actual value. A positive answer to this conjecture enables one to narrow down the location of thresholds for any increasing properties in a tiny window. In particular, this easily implies several previously very difficult results in probabilistic combinatorics such as thresholds for perfect hypergraph matchings (Johansson–Kahn–Vu) and bounded-degree spanning trees (Montgomery).

However, the standard methodology of evaluating LLMs based on static pairs of inputs and outputs is insufficient to be able to make an informed decision about which LLMs, and under what assistive settings they can be sensibly utilised. Static assessment fails to take into account the essential interactive element in their deployment, and therefore limits how we understand language model capabilities. In this talk, we present our recent work introducing CheckMate, an adaptable prototype platform for humans to interact with and evaluate LLMs. We discuss our study with CheckMate to evaluate three language models (InstructGPT, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) as assistants in proving undergraduate-level mathematics, with a mixed cohort of participants from undergraduate students to professors of mathematics. We release the resulting interaction and rating dataset, MathConverse. By analysing MathConverse, we derive a taxonomy of human behaviours and uncover that despite a generally positive correlation, there are notable instances of divergence between correctness and perceived helpfulness in LLM generations, amongst other findings. Further, we identify useful scenarios and existing issues of GPT-4 in mathematical reasoning through a series of case studies contributed by expert mathematicians. We conclude with actionable takeaways for ML practitioners and mathematicians: models which communicate uncertainty, respond well to user corrections, and are more interpretable and concise may constitute better assistants; interactive evaluation is a promising way to navigate the capability of these models; humans should be aware of language models’ algebraic fallibility and discern where they are appropriate to use.\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/95706757940?pwd=dHhMeXBtd1BhN0RuTWNQR0xEVzJkdz09\n\nPassword: cmsa", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-new-technologies-in-mathematics-seminar-evaluating-language-models-for-mathematics-through-interactions-2-2-2-2-2/"},

It is natural to ask whether we obtain more topological information by working with other choices of gauge groups such as SU(n) for higher values of n. Mariño and Moore formulated a conjecture essentially stating that there is no new information in Donaldson invariants of smooth 4-manifolds defined using SU(n) Yang-Mills gauge theory. Despite this \"negative\" prediction, one might still hope that there is still novel information about 3-manifolds in higher rank gauge theory.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss a result about the topology of 3-manifolds obtained using gauge theory with respect to the Lie group SU(3): for any knot K in the 3-dimensionl sphere (or more generally an integer homology sphere) there is a non-abelian representation of the knot group of K into SU(3) such that the homotopy class of the meridian of K is mapped to a matrix with eigenvalues 1, w, w^2 with w being a primitive third root of unity. As a byproduct of the proof, we obtain a structure theorem for SU(3) Donaldson invariants of 4-manifolds, analogous to Kronheimer and Mrowka's structure theorem for SU(2) Donaldson invariants. This can be regarded as a piece of evidence supporting Mariño and Moore's conjecture.

In the real of integrable systems, eigenvectors remain localized, and local eigenvalue statistics follow the Poisson distribution. Conversely, chaotic systems exhibit delocalized eigenvectors, with local eigenvalue statistics mirroring the Sine kernel distribution, akin to the standard random matrix ensembles GOE/GUE.\nThis talk delves into the heart of the Quantum Chaos Conjecture, presenting a novel approach through the lens of random matrix models.

The analysis of the patterns in the peaks and valleys of stochastic PDEs is crucial for gaining deeper insights into the underlying physical phenomena.\nOne notable example is the KPZ equation, a fundamental stochastic PDE associated with significant models like random growth processes, Burgers turbulence, interacting particle systems, and random polymers. The study of the fractal structures inherent in the KPZ equation provides a quantitative characterization of the intermittent nature of its peaks, as well as those of the stochastic heat equation—a subject that has been extensively explored over the past few decades.\nConversely, the Parabolic Anderson model (PAM) serves as a prototypical framework for simulating the conduction of electrons in crystals containing defects. Investigating the intermittency of peaks in the PAM has been a prominent area of research, closely tied to the phenomenon of Anderson localization.\nIn this presentation, we delve into the fractal geometry of both the KPZ equation and the PAM, unveiling their multifractal nature. Specifically, we demonstrate that the spatial and spatio-temporal peaks of these equations exhibit infinitely many distinct values. Furthermore, we compute the macroscopic Hausdorff dimension (introduced by Barlow and Taylor) associated with these peaks.\nThe key findings presented here stem from a series of works that employ a diverse array of tools, ranging from random matrix theory and the Gibbs property of random curves to the utilization of regularity structures and paracontrolled calculus.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/probability-seminar-fractal-geometry-of-stochastic-partial-differential-equations/"},

Earlier, in the 1880’s, Henri Poincaré and Felix Klein had also initiated a study of discrete groups of hyperbolic isometries. The geodesics in hyperbolic manifolds were discovered to carry a rich structure, first investigated from a topological perspective by Emil Artin and Marston Morse.  The time was ripe to investigate geodesics in hyperbolic manifolds from an ergodic theoretic (i.e., statistical) perspective, and indeed Gustav Hedlund proved in 1934 that the geodesic flow for closed hyperbolic surfaces is ergodic.\nIn 1939, Eberhard Hopf published a proof of the ergodicity of geodesic flows for negatively curved surfaces containing a novel method, now known as the Hopf argument.  The Hopf argument, a “soft” argument for ergodicity of systems with some hyperbolicity (the “stretching and shrinking” in the title) has since seen wide application in geometry, representation theory and dynamics.  I will discuss three results relying on the Hopf argument:\nTheorem (E. Hopf, 1939, D. Anosov, 1967): In a closed manifold of negative sectional curvatures, almost every geodesic is directionally equidistributed.\nTheorem (G.

Its higher-dimensional generalization is the moduli functor M_{n,v} of n-dimension stable varieties of volume v. It was proven only recently, and thanks to the joint effort of many over many years, that such functors are represented by projective algebraic spaces when working over the complex numbers. In this talk I will give some examples showing that the same moduli functors in positive characteristic are not even proper and, more in general, that the MMP fails to be functorial even in very nice families. In the second part I am going to explore some possible generalizations of the notion of stable variety that could be used as a replacement in positive characteristic.\n \nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/93338480366?pwd=NEROWElhWStQVjVLRVZFSm1tV1ZCdz09\n ", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/algebraic-geometry-in-string-theory-seminar-species-scale-across-string-moduli-spaces-3-2-2-2-2-2-3-2/"},

In joint work with Florent Hivert (Université Paris-Sud) we realize the n-th Okada algebra as a diagram algebra with a multiplicative/monoid basis consisting of n-strand Temperley-Lieb diagrams, each equipped with a \"height\" labeling of its strands. The proof involves a diagrammatic version of Fomin's Robinson-Schensted correspondence for the Young-Fibonacci lattice. This basis is cellular, which affords us with a novel, diagrammatic presentation of the irreducible representations of the Okada algebra (i.e. cell modules).\n===============================\nFor more info, see \nhttps://math.mit.edu/combin/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/richard-p-stanley-seminar-in-combinatorics-linear-relations-and-lorentzian-property-of-chromatic-symmetric-functions-2-3-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3/"},

This is the approach taken by Steenrod-Sitnikov homology and Lisica and Mardesic's strong homology. Even within the class of locally compact second countable spaces though, the properties of these homology theories -- and the higher derived limits which underly them -- are dependent on axioms of set theory beyond ZFC. Recently it was shown that it is consistent with (and therefore independent of) ZFC that strong homology and Steenrod Sitnikov homology coincide in the class of locally compact second countable spaces -- and therefore each of these homology theories enjoys the desirable properties of the other. These results also point to how we might develop variants of these homology theories which enjoy their desirable properties, but which are less sensitive to set theory.

The key idea is to observe the conceptual similarity between renormalization group (RG) flow and error correction, and to implement the latter as unitary circuits emulating the RG flow. Our algorithm guarantees faithful recognition of a target phase with a small number of input quantum state samples.\nIn the second half, we present a class of 2D Hamiltonians, where the exact ground state wavefunctions can be exactly evaluated and shown to exhibit anomalous entanglement properties. One class of our models exhibit area-law scaling entanglement entropy, but this is mostly due to non-local correlation: one finds that the topological entanglement entropy also scales with the size of subsystem choices. By making simple modifications, we can also devise 2D models with volume-law scaling bipartite entanglement entropy. Our results can be understood as a generation of the 1D Motzkin model to 2D systems.\nBased on:\n\nWork done with Ethan Lake and Shankar Balasubramanian\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09803\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07028", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-interacting-active-matter-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

To clarify the scope of Transformers' out-of-distribution generalization, we isolate this behavior in a specific controlled setting: length-generalization on algorithmic tasks. Eg: Can a model trained on 10 digit addition generalize to 50 digit addition? For which tasks do we expect this to work?\nOur key tool is the recently-introduced RASP language (Weiss et al 2021), which is a programming language tailor-made for the Transformer's computational model. We conjecture, informally, that: Transformers tend to length-generalize on a task if there exists a short RASP program that solves the task for all input lengths. This simple conjecture remarkably captures most known instances of length generalization on algorithmic tasks, and can also inform design of effective scratchpads. Finally, on the theoretical side, we give a simple separating example between our conjecture and the \"min-degree-interpolator\" model of learning from Abbe et al.

We introduce a simulation framework for strongly correlated quantum systems that can be represented by model spin Hamiltonians. Our approach leverages reconfigurable qubit architectures to programmably simulate real-time dynamics and introduces an algorithm for extracting chemically relevant spectral properties via classical co-processing of quantum measurement results. We develop a digital-analog simulation toolbox for efficient Hamiltonian time evolution utilizing digital Floquet engineering and hardware-optimized multi-qubit operations to accurately realize complex spin-spin interactions, and as an example present an implementation proposal based on Rydberg atom arrays. Then, we show how detailed spectral and other relevant chemical information can be extracted from these dynamics through snapshot measurements and single-ancilla control, enabling the evaluation of excitation energies and finite-temperature susceptibilities from a single-dataset. To illustrate the approach, we show how this method can be used to compute key properties of a polynuclear transition-metal catalyst and 2D magnetic materials.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126\n\n\n\n\nPassword: cmsa\n\n\n--------\n\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA Quantum Matter and other seminar videos\n\n(more to be uploaded):\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0NRmB0fnLJQAnYwkpt9PN2PBKx4rvdup\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA seminar mailing list:\n\n\nhttps://forms.gle/1ewa7KeP6BxBuBeRA", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-interacting-active-matter-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

We want to efficiently encode a function from [n] to {0,1} using local views in a way that admits local testability and the direct product encoding gives us the restriction of f on various subsets of [n]. A set system is said to support a direct product test when the following property holds: whenever a natural 2-query test passes with noticeable probability, the encoding is correlated to a direct-product encoding. We study the question of what hypergraph expansion properties are required of the set systems that support a direct product test in the list-decoding regime. In contrast to the unique-decoding regime, we show that spectral expansion is insufficient and the set-system must additionally possess a form of topological expansion called coboundary expansion. This also turns out to be sufficient, thus giving us a characterization of such set systems. Building set systems with these expansion properties would thus lead to the ultimate form of efficient direct product testers and perhaps also allow for efficient hardness amplification.\nBased on joint work with Dor Minzer (https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2023/120/)\n===============================\nFor more info, see \nhttps://math.mit.edu/combin/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/richard-p-stanley-seminar-in-combinatorics-linear-relations-and-lorentzian-property-of-chromatic-symmetric-functions-2-3-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2/"},

A more refined argument then shows that not only the black hole index but also the total number of black hole microstates within an energy window above extremality that is polynomially suppressed in the charges also matches this string theory index. In the second part of the talk, I will present a second perspective on this state count and show how the BPS Hilbert space can be obtained by directly preparing states using the gravitational path integral.

In this model, the quantum logical gates are implemented by short sequences of low-weight measurements which simultaneously encode logical information and enable error correction. We introduce a new class of quantum error-correcting codes generalizing Floquet codes that achieve this, which we call dynamic automorphism (DA) codes.\n\nAs in Floquet codes, the instantaneous codespace of a DA code at any fixed point in time is that of a topological code. In this case, the quantum computation can be viewed as a sequence of time-like domain walls implementing automorphisms of the topological order, which can be understood in terms of reversible anyon condensation paths in a particular parent model. This talk will introduce all of these concepts as well as provide a new perspective for thinking about Floquet codes.\n\nThe explicit examples that we construct, which we call DA color codes, can implement the full Clifford group of logical gates in 2+1d by two- and, rarely three-body measurements. Using adaptive two-body measurements, we can achieve a non-Clifford gate in 3+1d, making the first step towards universal quantum computation in this model.\n\nThe talk is based on recent work with Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Shankar Balasubramanian, and David Aasen [arxiv: 2307.10353].\nThis seminar will be held in person and on Zoom: https://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126\nPassword: cmsa", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-interacting-active-matter-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

The resulting Lagrangian Floer theory happens to be on the pillowcase. Viewing J# invariant from this angle, we will propose several modifications to the construction of representation varieties: two different reductions at two basepoints, and a passage to the equivariant theory (which corresponds to the wrapped Floer theory on the pillowcase). The advantage is that the resulting equivariant invariants are as simple as possible, and can be used to recover the initial unreduced invariants via mapping cones. Based on this we will speculate on the existence of the corresponding instanton-theoretic curve invariants in the pillowcase, and indicate an open-ended strategy for how to study the Tutte relation for J#(G).

In this talk, we show how non-equilibrium dynamics can provide a streamlined route toward creating QSLs. In particular, we show how a simple Hamiltonian parameter sweep can dynamically project out condensed anyons from a family of initial product states (e.g. dynamically  \"un-Higgs\"), yielding a QSL-like state. We christen such states \"quantum spin lakes\" which, while not thermodynamically large QSLs, enable their study in NISQ-era quantum simulators. Indeed, we show that this mechanism sheds light on recent experimental and numerical observations of the dynamical state preparation of the ruby lattice spin liquid in Rydberg atom arrays. Time permitting, we will discuss how our theory motivates a tree tensor network-based numerical tool---reliant on our theory---that quantitatively reproduces the experimental data two orders of magnitude faster than conventional brute-force simulation methods.

As an application, this result justifies the convexity of the Monge—Ampère equation, the J-equation, the dHYM equation, the special Lagrangian equation, etc. Second, I will introduce some semialgebraic sets and a special class of univariate polynomials and give a Positivstellensatz type result. These give a numerical criterion to verify whether the level set will be contained in the positive orthant.

But it often happens that the arithmetic objects of interest correspond to orbits that lie on a proper subvariety of V. In such cases, geometry-of-numbers methods do not suffice to obtain precise asymptotics, and more sophisticated point-counting techniques are required.

In this talk, we show how non-equilibrium dynamics can provide a streamlined route toward creating QSLs. In particular, we show how a simple Hamiltonian parameter sweep can dynamically project out condensed anyons from a family of initial product states (e.g. dynamically  \"un-Higgs\"), yielding a QSL-like state. We christen such states \"quantum spin lakes\" which, while not thermodynamically large QSLs, enable their study in NISQ-era quantum simulators. Indeed, we show that this mechanism sheds light on recent experimental and numerical observations of the dynamical state preparation of the ruby lattice spin liquid in Rydberg atom arrays. Time permitting, we will discuss how our theory motivates a tree tensor network-based numerical tool---reliant on our theory---that quantitatively reproduces the experimental data two orders of magnitude faster than conventional brute-force simulation methods.

Black hole (BH) QNMs encode the resonant response of black holes under linear perturbations, their associated complex frequencies providing an invariant probe into the background spacetime geometry. In the late nineties, Nollert and Price found evidence of a BH QNM instability phenomenon, according to which perturbed QNMs of Schwarzschild spacetime migrate to new perturbed branches of different qualitative behaviour and asymptotics. Here we revisit this BH QNM instability issue by adopting a pseudospectrum approach. Specifically, we cast the QNM problem as an eigenvalue problem for a non-selfadjoint operator by adopting a hyperboloidal formulation of spacetime. Non-selfadjoint (more generally non-normal) operators suffer potentially of spectral instabilities, the notion of pseudospectrum providing a tool suitable for their study. We find evidence that perturbed Nollert & Price BH QNMs track the pseudospectrum contour lines, therefore probing the analytic structure of the resolvent, showing the following (in)stability behaviour: i) the slowest decaying (fundamental) mode is stable, whereas ii) (all) QNM overtones are ultraviolet unstable (for sufficiently high frequency). Building on recent work characterizing Burnett’s conjecture as a low-regularity problem in general relativity, we conjecture that (in the infinite-frequency limit) generic ultraviolet spacetime perturbations make BH QNMs migrate to ‘Regge QNM branches’ with a precise universal logarithmic pattern. This is a classical general relativity (effective) low-regularity phenomenon, agnostic to possible detailed (quantum) descriptions of gravity at higher-energies and potentially observationally accessible.\n \nThis seminar will be held on Zoom.

A key feature of such systems is the emergence of concentration gradients even at steady states. In the second part of this talk, I will discuss how these gradients can trigger instabilities in the core of chemically active droplets, giving rise to a new non-equilibrium steady state of liquid spherical shells. Finally, I will present experimental and theoretical results discussing the existence and energetic cost of this non-equilibrium steady state in a coacervate system.\nThis seminar will be held in person and on Zoom.

These autonomous oscillators are coupled through a nonlinear interaction term which plays a central role in the long term behavior of the system. While the system is not synchronized when this term is not sufficiently strong, fascinatingly, they exhibit an abrupt transition to a full synchronization above a critical value of the interaction parameter.  We explore this system in the mean field formalism.  We treat the system of oscillators as an infinite particle system, but instead of positing the dynamics of the particles, we let the individual particles determine endogenously their behaviors by minimizing a cost functional and eventually, settling in a Nash equilibrium.  The mean field game also exhibits a bifurcation from incoherence to self-organization.  This approach has found interesting applications including circadian rhythms and jet-lag recovery.  This is joint work with Rene Carmona of Princeton and Quentin Cormier of INRIA, Paris.\n ", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-colloquium-neural-optimal-stopping-boundary-2-3-2-2-2/"},

Understanding how active morphogenetic mechanisms couple cellular and mechanical processes to generate order remains an outstanding question in animal development. I will review the statistical mechanics of orientational order and discuss the observation of a fourfold orientationally ordered phase (tetratic) in the model organism Parhyale hawaiensis. I will also discuss theoretical mechanisms for the formation of orientational order that require both motility and cell division, with support from self-propelled vertex models of tissue.

In 2013, Pink observed that when d=2 and the two critical points c_1, c_2 collide, meaning that f^m(c_1)=f^m(c_2) for some m>0, then the arboreal Galois groups are strictly smaller than the full automorphism group of the tree.

The anti-de Sitter (AdS)/conformal field theory correspondence or duality is the principal example of holography. The Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev (SYK) model of N >> 1 Majorana fermions has features suggesting the existence of a gravitational dual in AdS2, and is a new realization of holography. We invoke the holographic correspondence of the SYK many-body system and gravity to probe the conjectured ER=EPR relation between entanglement and spacetime geometry through the traversable wormhole mechanism as implemented in the SYK model. A qubit can be used to probe the SYK traversable wormhole dynamics through the corresponding teleportation protocol. This can be realized as a quantum circuit, equivalent to the gravitational picture in the semiclassical limit of an infinite number of qubits. Here we use learning techniques to construct a sparsified SYK model that we experimentally realize with 164 two-qubit gates on a nine-qubit circuit and observe the corresponding traversable wormhole dynamics. Despite its approximate nature, the sparsified SYK model preserves key properties of the traversable wormhole physics: perfect size winding, coupling on either side of the wormhole that is consistent with a negative energy shockwave, a Shapiro time delay, causal time-order of signals emerging from the wormhole, and scrambling and thermalization dynamics. Our experiment was run on the Google Sycamore processor. By interrogating a two-dimensional gravity dual system, our work represents a step towards a program for studying quantum gravity in the laboratory. Future developments will require improved hardware scalability and performance as well as theoretical developments including higher-dimensional quantum gravity duals and other SYK-like models.\n--------\n\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA Quantum Matter and other seminar videos\n\n(more to be uploaded):\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/\nplaylist?list=\nPL0NRmB0fnLJQAnYwkpt9PN2PBKx4r\nvdup\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA seminar mailing list:\n\n\nhttps://forms.gle/\n1ewa7KeP6BxBuBeRA\n ", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-reflections-on-parity-breaking-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-3/"},

Such states feature intriguing physical properties such as long-range entanglement, emergent gauge fields and non-local correlations, and can aid in realization of  scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, these same features also make creation, detection, and characterization of topologically-ordered states particularly challenging. Motivated by recent experimental demonstrations, we introduce a new paradigm for quantifying topological states---locally error-corrected decoration (LED)---by combining methods of  error correction with ideas of renormalization-group flow. Our approach allows for efficient and robust identification of topological order, and is applicable in the presence of incoherent noise sources, making it particularly  suitable for realistic experiments. We demonstrate the power of LED using numerical simulations of the toric code under a variety of perturbations, and we subsequently apply it to an experimental realization of a quantum spin liquid using a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator.  Finally, we illustrate how LED can be applied to more general phases including non-abelian topological orders.\n--------\n\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA Quantum Matter and other seminar videos\n\n(more to be uploaded):\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/\nplaylist?list=\nPL0NRmB0fnLJQAnYwkpt9PN2PBKx4r\nvdup\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA seminar mailing list:\n\n\nhttps://forms.gle/\n1ewa7KeP6BxBuBeRA\n ", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-reflections-on-parity-breaking-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2/"},

But observations since then have shown that the low temperature phase diagram is dominated by conventional states, with a competition between superconductivity and charge-ordered states which break translational symmetry. We employ the \"pseudogap metal\" phase, found at intermediate temperatures and low hole doping, as the parent to the phases found at lower temperatures. The pseudogap metal is described as a fractionalized phase of a single-band model, with small pocket Fermi surfaces of electron-like quasiparticles whose enclosed area is not equal to the free electron value, and an underlying pi-flux spin liquid with an emergent SU(2) gauge field. This pi-flux spin liquid is now known to be unstable to confinement at sufficiently low energies. We develop a theory of the different routes to confinement of the pi-flux spin liquid, and show that d-wave superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, and charge order are natural outcomes. We argue that this theory provides routes to resolving a number of open puzzles on the cuprate phase diagram.\nThis talk is based on Maine Christos, Zhu-Xi Luo, Henry Shackleton, Mathias S.

In this talk, we give interpretations of Klyachko data in terms of valuations with values in a certain meet-join lattice as well as points on a tropical linear space.

In eukaryotic cells, these subcellular structures are often membrane-bound organelles, whose volume is the physiologically important aspect of their size. Scaling organelle volume with cell volume can be explained by limiting pool mechanisms, wherein a constant concentration of molecular building blocks enables subcellular structures to increase in size proportionally with cell volume. However, limiting pool mechanisms cannot explain how the size of linear subcellular structures, such as cytoskeletal filaments, scale with the linear dimensions of the cell. Recently, we discovered that the length of actin cables in budding yeast (used for intracellular transport) precisely matches the length of the cell in which they are assembled. Using mathematical modeling and quantitative\n\nimaging of actin cable growth dynamics, we found that as the actin cables grow longer, their extension rates slow (or decelerate), enabling cable length to match cell length. Importantly, this deceleration behavior is cell-length dependent, allowing cables in longer cells to grow faster, and therefore reach a longer length before growth stops at the back of the cell. In addition, we have unexpectedly found that cable length is specified by cable shape. Our imaging analysis reveals that cables progressively taper as they extend from the bud neck into the mother cell, and further, this tapering scales with cell length. Integrating observations made for tapering actin networks in other systems, we have developed a novel mathematical model for cable length control that recapitulates our quantitative experimental observations. Unlike other models of size control, this model does not require length-dependent rates of assembly\n\nor disassembly. Instead, feedback control over the length of the cable is an emergent property due to the cross-linked and bundled architecture of the actin filaments within the cable. This work reveals a new strategy that cells use to coordinate the size of their internal parts with their linear dimensions. Similar design principles may control the size and scaling of other subcellular structures whose physiologically important dimension is their length.\nThis seminar will be held in person and on Zoom.

In fact, Bloch's results about the Ceresa cycle of Fermat quartics provided the first concrete evidence for the generalization of the BSD conjecture to the Bloch-Beilinson conjectures.\nWe will survey several recent results about the Ceresa cycle and the Ceresa class. The Ceresa class vanishes for all hyperelliptic curves and was expected to be nonvanishing for non-hyperelliptic curves. We will present joint work with Dean Bisogno, Wanlin Li and Daniel Litt, where we construct a non-hyperelliptic genus 3 quotient of the Fricke--Macbeath curve with torsion Ceresa class, using the character theory of the automorphism group of the curve, namely, PSL2(F8).\n.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/harvard-mit-algebraic-geometry-seminar-2-2-2-4-2-2-2-2/"},

Great math theorems bridge fields, enabling us to transfer tools from one to another, exhibiting overarching themes that unify mathematics. Mostow rigidity is such a theorem. It proves the uniqueness of geometric structures on spaces of dimension at least three, demonstrating a deep connection between topology and geometry. Most 3-dimensional spaces are hyperbolic, meaning “negatively curved\" like a hyperboloid. Understanding hyperbolic spaces is important to topology, algebra, dynamics, and more. This theory is critical to the geometrization theorem, perhaps the most celebrated result in geometry. Mostow rigidity shows that any homotopy equivalence between two hyperbolic manifolds, a topological relationship, can be uniquely deformed to an isometry, a geometric one. Mostow’s own proof uses quasi-conformal theory to improve an initial function only preserves the topological structure into one that preserves the geometric structure, linking the two notions of equivalence. The second proof defines a topological quantity capturing a manifold’s complexity, and computes the volume for hyperbolic manifolds. The algebraic realization of a hyperbolic manifold encodes the geometric data of which simplices (higher-dimensional triangles) have maximal volume, which are rigid above dimension two.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/special-lecture-when-do-varieties-map-to-each-other-2/"},

Let $P\\subseteq\\R^d\n$ be a rational  convex polytope, that is, a polytope with vertices in $\\mathbb{Q}^d$, then the Ehrhart function of the polytope $i(P,n)$ counts the number of integer lattice of the dilation $nP$ (here $nP$ denotes the polytope obtained from dilating $P$ by a factor n). Ehrhart functions have a rich history and many wonderful properties (e.g., Ehrhart himself proved that when $P$ is a lattice polytope, then $i(P,n)$ is a polynomial of degree $dim(P)$. The connections to Hilbert series are legendary). This topic has appeared in algebraic combinatorics, representation theory, algebraic geometry and others areas. But what if we count the integer lattice points with *weights*? Say  $w: \\R^d \\to \\R$   a  function, often called a  \\emph{weight function}. We can consider the, \\emph{weighted Ehrhart} function: \\[ i(P,w,n)=\\sum_ {x\\in nP \\cap \\Z^d} w(x).  \\] (Here $w(x) := w(x_1,\\dots,x_d\n)$ runs over the set of integer points belonging to $P$)\nIn this lecture I review what we know about weighted Ehrhart functions.\nSome basic things remain true, other classical results have delicate variations and extensions. I will discuss several new theorems:\n1) We generalized R. Stanley's theorem that the $h^\\ast$-polyno\nmial of the Ehrhart series of a rational polytope has nonnegative coefficients and is monotone under containment of polytopes.  We show that these results continue to hold for \\emph{weighted} Ehrhart series where lattice points are counted with polynomial weights, as long as the weights are homogeneous polynomials decomposable as sums of products of linear forms that are nonnegative on the polytope.\n2) We also investigated  nonnegativity of the $h^\\ast$-polyno\nmial as a real-valued function for  a larger family of weights. In fact, discuss the case of  counting lattice points of a polytope that are weighted not by a simple polynomial, but by an Ehrhart quasi-polynomia\nl of a family of parametric polytopes. As applications one can compute integrals and maximum values of such quasi-polynomia\nls. We obtain new identities in representation theory and semigroup theory similar to RSK.\nThis work comprises 3 papers joint work with subsets of the following wonderful people: Esme Bajo, Rob Davis, Laura Escobar, Alexey Garber, Katharina Jochemko, Nathan Kaplan, Sofia Garzon-Mora, Josephine Yu, Rafael Villarreal, and Chengyang Wang.\n==============================\n=========================\nFor information about the Combinatorics Seminar, please visit:\nhttp://math.mit.edu/seminars/c\nombin/\n==============================\n===============", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/mit-harvard-msr-combinatorics-seminar-realizable-standard-young-tableaux-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

In particular, excitations that cannot move without creating other excitations are called fractons.

Surprisingly, we demonstrate how fractons can be exchanged, and show their self-statistics is a key part of the characterization of fracton orders. We derive general constraints satisfied by the fracton self-statistics in a large class of abelian fracton orders. Finally, we show the existence of semionic or fermionic fracton self-statistics in some twisted variants of the checkerboard model and Haah's code, establishing that these models are in distinct quantum phases as compared to their untwisted cousins.\nReferences: H Song, N Tantivasadakarn, W Shirley, M Hermele, arXiv:2304.00028.\n--------\n\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA Quantum Matter and other seminar videos\n\n(more to be uploaded):\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/\nplaylist?list=\nPL0NRmB0fnLJQAnYwkpt9PN2PBKx4r\nvdup\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA seminar mailing list:\n\n\nhttps://forms.gle/\n1ewa7KeP6BxBuBeRA\n ", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-reflections-on-parity-breaking-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

In two dimensions, the conformal group possesses infinite generators described by Virasoro algebra with an essential parameter known as a central charge. While the central charge manifests itself in a variety of quantities, its detection in experimental setup remains elusive. In this work, we utilize Shannon-Renyi entropy on a local basis of a one-dimensional quantum spin chain at a critical point. We first use a simulated variational quantum eigen solver to prepare the ground state of the critical transfer field Ising model and XXZ model with open and periodic boundary conditions and perform local Pauli X and Z basis measurements. Using error mitigation such as probabilistic error cancellation, we extract an estimation of the local Pauli observables needed to determine the Shannon-Renyi entropy with respect to subsystem size. Finally, we obtain the central charge in the sub-leading term of Shannon-Renyi entropy.\nThis seminar will be hybrid - in person and virtual.\n--------\n\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA Quantum Matter and other seminar videos\n\n(more to be uploaded):\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/\nplaylist?list=\nPL0NRmB0fnLJQAnYwkpt9PN2PBKx4r\nvdup\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA seminar mailing list:\n\n\nhttps://forms.gle/\n1ewa7KeP6BxBuBeRA\n ", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-reflections-on-parity-breaking-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

The Drinfeld center of a fusion category $A$ describes a $(2+1)D$ topological order whose gapped boundaries enumerate all $(1+1)D$ gapped phases with the fusion category symmetry, which may be spontaneously broken. There always exists a gapped boundary, given by the \\emph{electric} Lagrangian algebra, that describes a phase with $A$ fully spontaneously broken. The symmetry defects of this boundary can be identified with the objects in $A$. We observe that if there exists a different gapped boundary, given by a \\emph{magnetic} Lagrangian algebra, then there exists a gapped phase where $A$ is not spontaneously broken at all, which means that $A$ is not anomalous. In certain cases, we show that requiring the existence of such a magnetic Lagrangian algebra leads to highly computable obstructions to $A$ being anomaly-free. As an application, we consider the Drinfeld centers of $\\mathbb{Z}_N\\times\\mathbb{Z}_\nN$ Tambara-Yamagami fusion categories and recover known results from the study of fiber functors.\nThis seminar will be virtual.\n--------\n\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA Quantum Matter and other seminar videos\n\n(more to be uploaded):\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/\nplaylist?list=\nPL0NRmB0fnLJQAnYwkpt9PN2PBKx4r\nvdup\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA seminar mailing list:\n\n\nhttps://forms.gle/\n1ewa7KeP6BxBuBeRA\n ", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-reflections-on-parity-breaking-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

There is a very abstract theory of (qualitative) homogenization, which is classical. We will discuss the more concrete theory of quantitative homogenization, which has been developed recently. A central role in the story concerns certain \"coarse-graining\" arguments, which can be seen as constituting a rigorous renormalization group-type approach, formulated in the language of analysis. These methods have surprising applications in mathematical physics and probability, which are still emerging.

Then I will talk about a systematic way of deriving pole-skipping conditions for general holographic CFTs dual to classical bulk theories and how to use this framework to derive a few interesting statements including: (1) theories with higher spins generally violate the chaos bound; (2) the butterfly velocity calculated using pole skipping agrees with that calculated using shockwaves for arbitrary higher-derivative gravity coupled to ordinary matter; (3) shockwaves are related to a special type of quasinormal modes.

To do so they developed a `Y-system' for computing the amplitude.  This talk re-interprets their construction as providing the underlying twistor space for a hyperKahler structure on the corresponding space of kinematic data. In particular, the area is given by a Kahler scalar for the pseudo-hyperkahler structure and satisfies a version of the Plebanski equations, a well-known completely integrable system.  This geometry encodes the properties of the space of kinematic data on which the amplitude depends as a cluster variety tying into its positive geometry and cluster variety structure.  Similar constructures are possible for other cluster varieties corresponding to form factors and beyond.\nZoom Link:\n \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/96433200974", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-interacting-active-matter-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2/"},

In this talk, I will try to give some intuition for why three dimensions is different from two, explain how to formulate the large deviations principle in 3D, show simulations, and explain some of the ways that we use a smaller set of tools (e.g. Hall’s matching theorem or a double dimer swapping operation) in our arguments.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-interacting-active-matter-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2/"},

In particular, we investigate quantum many-body systems under weak-measurement and decoherence. The Euclidean space-time path integral allows us to map this problem to a quantum field theory with (temporal) boundary or defects. We therefore investigate two types of quantum many-body systems with nontrivial boundary physics: quantum critical points, and states with nontrivial topology, such as Chern insulator and symmetry protected topological states. For example, we demonstrate that a Wilson-Fisher quantum critical point can be driven into an \"extraordinary-log\" phase after weak-measurement. Another example is that, we argue that a system with higher form symmetry may be driven to a self-dual phase transition under weak-measurement.\nZoom: https://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126\n\nPassword: cmsa", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-interacting-active-matter-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

The key idea is to observe the conceptual similarity between renormalization group (RG) flow and error correction, and to implement the latter as unitary circuits emulating the RG flow. Our algorithm guarantees faithful recognition of a target phase with a small number of input quantum state samples.\nIn the second half, we present a class of 2D Hamiltonians, where the exact ground state wavefunctions can be exactly evaluated and shown to exhibit anomalous entanglement properties. One class of our models exhibit area-law scaling entanglement entropy, but this is mostly due to non-local correlation: one finds that the topological entanglement entropy also scales with the size of subsystem choices. By making simple modifications, we can also devise 2D models with volume-law scaling bipartite entanglement entropy. Our results can be understood as a generation of the 1D Motzkin model to 2D systems.\nBased on:\nWork done with Ethan Lake and Shankar Balasubramanian\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09803\n\n\n \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126\n\n\n\n\nPassword: cmsa\n\n", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-interacting-active-matter-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

At filling -2/3, we describe a direct transition between the FQAH state\n\nand a Charge Density Wave (CDW) insulator. The critical theory resembles that of the familiar deconfined\n\nquantum critical point (DQCP) but with an additional Chern-Simons term. At filling -1/2, we study the\n\npossibility of a continuous transition between the composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and the Fermi liquid (FL)\n\nbuilding on and refining previous work by Barkeshli and McGreevy.

With the gradient expansion to the second order, the continuum theory for MATBG [2] produces the spectrum that almost perfectly matches the spectrum of the microscopic model, suggesting the validity of this theory. In the presence of the lattice deformation, the inclusion of the pseudo-vector potential does not destroy but shift the flat band chiral limit to a smaller twist angle. Furthermore, the continuum theory contains another important interlayer tunneling term that was overlooked in all previous works.

However, how the interplay of mechanical interactions and the modes of collective self-organization among cells informs such processes is yet to be established. In this talk, I will focus on the role of three-dimensional force transmission, from a theoretical and computational perspective, on two phenomena: (1) cell extrusion from a cellular monolayer and (2) density-independent solid-like to fluid-like transition of active cell layers. For the first topic, I will focus on how increasing cell-cell adhesion relative to cell-substrate adhesion enables cells to collectively exploit distinct mechanical pathways – leveraging defects in nematic and hexatic phases associated with cellular arrangement – to eliminate an unwanted cell. For the second topic, I will show how solid-like to fluid-like transition in active cell layers is linked to the percolation of isotropic stresses. This is achieved via two distinct and independent paths to model this transition by increasing (a) cell-cell adhesion and (b) active traction forces. Additionally, using finite-size scaling analyses, the phase transition associated with each path is mapped onto the 2D site percolation universality class. Our results highlight the importance of force transmission in informing the collective behavior of living cells and opens the door to new sets of questions for those interested in connecting the physics of cellular self-organization to the dynamics of biological systems.\nThis seminar will be held in person and on Zoom.

Designed in 1962 and awarded the Nobel Prize in 2012, this algorithm has been used around the world in settings ranging from matching students to schools to matching medical doctors to residencies. A hallmark of this algorithm is that unlike many other matching algorithms, it is \"strategy-proof\": participants can never gain by misreporting their preferences (say, over schools) to the algorithm. Alas, this property is far from apparent from the algorithm description. Its mathematical proof is so delicate and complex, that (for example) school districts in which it is implemented do not even attempt to explain to students and parents why this property holds, but rather resort to an appeal to authority: Nobel laureates have proven this property, so one should listen to them. Unsurprisingly perhaps, there is a growing body of evidence that participants in Deferred Acceptance attempt (unsuccessfully) to \"game it,\" which results in a suboptimal match for themselves and for others.\nBy developing a novel framework of algorithm description simplicity—grounded at the intersection between Economics and Computer Science—we present a novel, starkly different, yet equivalent, description for the Deferred Acceptance algorithm, which, in a precise sense, makes its strategyproofness far more apparent. Our description does have a downside, though: some other of its most fundamental properties—for instance, that no school exceeds its capacity—are far less apparent than from all traditional descriptions of the algorithm. Using the theoretical framework that we develop, we mathematically address the question of whether and to what extent this downside is unavoidable, providing a possible explanation for why our description of the algorithm has eluded discovery for over half a century. Indeed, it seems that in the design of all traditional descriptions of the algorithm, it was taken for granted that properties such as no capacity getting exceeded should be apparent. Our description emphasizes the property that is important for participants to correctly interact with the algorithm, at the expense of properties that are mostly of interest to policy makers, and thus has the potential of vastly improving access to opportunity for many populations. Our theory provides a principled way of recasting algorithm descriptions in a way that makes certain properties of interest easier to explain and grasp, which we also support with behavioral experiments in the lab.\nJoint work with Ori Heffetz and Clayton Thomas.\n ", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-colloquium-strategyproof-exposing-mechanisms-descriptions/"},

Finally, we study how the preferred values of the oblique parameters may be generated in the context of models affecting the electroweak sector at tree- and loop-level.

Recently, Glock, Kühn, Lo, and Osthus and independently Bohman and Warnke proved the approximate version of Erdős' conjecture. Just this year, Kwan, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin proved Erdős' conjecture. As for Steiner systems with more general parameters, Glock, Kühn, Lo, and Osthus conjectured the existence of high girth (n,q,r)-Steiner systems. We prove the approximate version of their conjecture.  This result follows from our general main results which concern finding perfect or almost perfect matchings in a hypergraph G avoiding a given set of submatchings (which we view as a hypergraph H where V(H)=E(G)). Our first main result is a common generalization of the classical theorems of Pippenger (for finding an almost perfect matching) and Ajtai, Komlós, Pintz, Spencer, and Szemerédi (for finding an independent set in girth five hypergraphs). More generally, we prove this for coloring and even list coloring, and also generalize this further to when H is a hypergraph with small codegrees (for which high girth designs is a specific instance). Indeed, the coloring version of our result even yields an almost partition of K_n^r into approximate high girth (n,q,r)-Steiner systems.  If time permits, I will explain some of the other applications of our main results such as to rainbow matchings.  This is joint work with Luke Postle.\nFor information on how to join, please see:  https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/seminars-and-colloquium/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-combinatorics-physics-and-probability-hypergraph-matchings-avoiding-forbidden-submatchings/"},

Exponentially vanishing gradients, known as barren plateaus, have been shown to occur for various situations, including circuits that are either deep or noisy or that generate much entanglement. This can lead to exponential resource scaling for algorithms based on PQCs. On the flip side, some architectures for PQCs have been proven to be immune to barren plateaus. Moreover, the dynamical Lie algebra for a PQC has been connected to presence or absence of barren plateaus, leading to an algebraic theory for the trainability of PQCs. This theory could allow us to engineer favorable training landscapes for PQCs.

For a given CFT with a global symmetry, we consider symmetric gapping potentials which are relevant perturbations to the CFT. If a gapping potential is introduced only in a subregion of the system, it provides a certain boundary condition to the CFT. From this equivalence, if there exists a Cardy boundary state which is invariant under a symmetry, then the CFT can be gapped with a unique ground state by adding the corresponding gapping potential. This means that the symmetry of the CFT is anomaly free. Using this approach, we will systematically deduce the anomaly-free conditions for various types of CFTs with several different symmetries. When the symmetry of the CFT is anomalous, it implies a Lieb- Schultz-Mattis type ingappability of the system. Our results are consistent with, where available, known results in the literature. Moreover, we extend the discussion to other symmetries including spin groups and generalized time-reversal symmetries. As an application, we propose 1d LSM theorem involving magnetic space group symmetries on the lattice.

This is in stark contrast with the vectorlike gauge theories for which we have many solid results, thanks to some exact theorems, to the lattice simulation studies, to the Seiberg-Witten exact solution of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories, and last, but not the least, to the real-world strong-interaction phenomenology and experimental tests of Quantum Chromodynamics. \nThe purpose of this seminar is to discuss the results of our recent efforts to improve the understanding of the strongly-coupled chiral gauge theories. Among the main tools of analysis are the consideration of anomalies.  We use both the conventional ’t Hooft anomaly-matching ideas, and new, more stringent constraints coming from the generalized anomalies involving some higher-form symmetries.  Also, the so-called strong anomalies, little considered in the context of chiral gage theories, are found to carry significant implications.  \n As the playground we study several classes of SU(N) gauge theories, the so-called Bars-Yankielowicz models, the generalized Georgi-Glashow models, as well as a few other simple theories with the fermions in complex, anomaly-free  representations of the color SU(N).  \n Color-flavor-locked dynamical Higgs phase and dynamical Abelianization, emerge, among others, as two particularly interesting possible phases the system can flow into in the infrared, depending on the matter fermion content of the model.\nPart II: Quantum fluctuations, particles and entanglements: towards the solution of the Quantum Measurement Problem\nThe quantum measurement problems are revisited from a new perspective.  One of the main ideas of this work is that the basic entities of our world are various types of particles, elementary or composite. It follows that  each elementary process, hence each measurement process at its core, is a spacetime, pointlike, event. \nAnother key idea is that, when a  microsystem  $\\psi$  gets into contact with the experimental device,  factorization of $\\psi$ rapidly fails and entangled mixed states appear.\nThe wave functions for the microsystem-apparatus coupled systems for different measurement outcomes then lack overlapping spacetime support. It means that  the aftermath of each measurement is a single term in the sum: the fact  sometimes perceived as the ``wave-function collapse\". \nOur discussion leading to a diagonal density matrix shows how the information encoded in the wave function gets transcribed, via entanglement with the experimental device and environment, into the relative frequencies for various experimental results.   \nThese results represent new, significant steps towards filling in the logical gaps in the standard interpretation based on Born's rule, replacing it with a more natural one. Accepting objective reality of quantum fluctuations, independent of any experiments, and independently of human presence, one renounces for good  the idea that in a fundamental, complete theory of Nature the result of each single experiment must necessarily be predictable. \nA few well-known puzzles such as the Schr\\\"odinger cat conundrum and the EPR paradox will be briefly revisited: they can all be naturally explained away. \nFor more information on how to join, please see: https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/quantum-matter-seminar/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics/"},

However, how cortical tissue develops postnatally is largely unknown. By combining T\n1\n relaxation time from quantitative MRI and mean diffusivity (MD) from diffusion MRI, we tracked cortical tissue development in infants across three timepoints (newborn, 3 months, and 6 months). Lower T\n1\n and MD indicate higher microstructural tissue density and more developed cortex. Our data reveal three main findings: First, primary sensory-motor areas (V1: visual, A1: auditory, S1: somatosensory, M1: motor) have lower T\n1 \nand MD at birth than higher-level cortical areas. However, all primary areas show significant reductions in T\n1 \nand MD in the first six months of life, illustrating profound tissue growth after birth. Second, significant reductions in T\n1 \nand MD from newborns to 6-month-olds occur in all visual areas of the ventral and dorsal visual streams. Strikingly, this development was heterogenous across the visual hierarchies: Earlier areas are more developed with denser tissue at birth than higher-order areas, but higher-order areas had faster rates of development. Finally, analysis of transcriptomic gene data that compares gene expression in postnatal vs. prenatal tissue samples showed strong postnatal expression of genes associated with myelination, synaptic signaling, and dendritic processes. Our results indicate that these cellular processes may contribute to profound postnatal tissue growth in sensory cortices observed in our \nin-vivo\n measurements. We propose a novel principle of postnatal maturation of sensory systems: development of cortical tissue proceeds in a hierarchical manner, enabling the lower-level areas to develop first to provide scaffolding for higher-order areas, which begin to develop more rapidly following birth to perform complex computations for vision and audition.\n \nThis work is published here: \nhttps://www.nature.com/\narticles/s42003-021-02706-w\nFor information on how to join, please see:  https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/seminars-and-colloquium/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-interdisciplinary-science-seminar-infants-sensory-motor-cortices-undergo-microstructural-tissue-growth-coupled-with-myelination/"},

Such variations are manifestations of heterogeneity, whose spatial and temporal behavior is hard to describe theoretically. In the context of cancer, intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH), characterized by cells with genetic and phenotypic variability that co-exist within a single tumor, is often the cause of ineffective therapy and recurrence of cancer. Next-generation sequencing, obtained by sampling multiple regions of a single tumor (multi-region sequencing, M-Seq), has vividly demonstrated the pervasive nature of ITH, raising the need for a theory that accounts for evolution of tumor heterogeneity. Here, we develop a statistical mechanical theory to quantify ITH, using the Hamming distance, between genetic mutations in distinct regions within a single tumor. An analytic expression for ITH, expressed in terms of cell division probability (α) and mutation probability (p), is validated using cellular-automaton type simulations. Application of the theory successfully captures ITH extracted from M-seq data in patients with exogenous cancers (melanoma and lung). The theory, based on punctuated evolution at the early stages of the tumor followed by neutral evolution, is accurate provided the spatial variation in the tumor mutation burden is not large. We show that there are substantial variations in ITH in distinct regions of a single solid tumor, which supports the notion that distinct subclones could co-exist. The simulations show that there are substantial variations in the sub-populations, with the ITH increasing as the distance between the regions increases. The analytical and simulation framework developed here could be used in the quantitative analyses of the experimental (M-Seq) data. More broadly, our theory is likely to be useful in analyzing dynamic heterogeneity in complex systems such as supercooled liquids.\nFor more information on how to join,  please see: https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/interdisciplinary-science-seminar/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-interdisciplinary-science-seminar-statistical-mechanical-theory-for-spatio-temporal-evolution-of-intra-tumor-heterogeneity-in-cancers-analysis-of-multiregion-sequencing-data/"},

Some of these networks could have up to millions of edge insertions and deletions per second. In light of these highly dynamic networks, we propose various scalable and accurate graph algorithms for a variety of problems. In this talk, I will discuss new algorithms for various graph problems in the batch-dynamic model in shared-memory architectures where updates to the graph arrive in multiple batches of one or more updates. I'll also briefly discuss my work in other dynamic models such as distributed dynamic models where the communication topology of the network also changes with time (ITCS 2022). In these models, I will present efficient algorithms for graph problems including k-core decomposition, low out-degree orientation, matching, triangle counting, and coloring.\nSpecifically, in the batch-dynamic model where we are given a batch of B updates, I'll discuss an efficient O(B log^2 n) amortized work and O(log^2 n log log n) depth algorithm that gives a (2+\\epsilon)-approximation on the k-core decomposition after each batch of updates (SPAA 2022). We also obtain new batch-dynamic algorithms for matching, triangle counting, and coloring using techniques and data structures developed in our k-core decomposition algorithm. In addition to our theoretical results, we implemented and experimentally evaluated our k-core decomposition algorithm on a 30-core machine with two-way hyper-threading on 11 graphs of varying densities and sizes. Our experiments show improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms even on machines with only 4 cores (your standard laptop).

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can be viewed as nonlinear sieves that can approximate complex functions of high dimensional covariates more effectively than linear sieves. In this talk we present ANN optimal estimation and inference on  policy functionals, such as average elasticities or value functions, of unknown structural functions of endogenous covariates. We provide ANN efficient estimation and optimal t based confidence interval for regular policy functionals such as average derivatives in nonparametric instrumental variables regressions. We also present ANN quasi likelihood ratio based inference for possibly irregular policy functionals of general nonparametric conditional moment restrictions (such as quantile instrumental variables models or Bellman equations) for time series data. We conduct intensive Monte Carlo studies to investigate computational issues with ANN based optimal estimation and inference in economic structural models with endogeneity. For economic data sets that do not have very high signal to noise ratios, there are current gaps between theoretical advantage of ANN approximation theory vs inferential performance in finite samples.\n\nSome of the results are applied to efficient estimation and optimal inference for average price elasticity in consumer demand and BLP type demand.\nThe talk is based on two co-authored papers:\n\n(1) Efficient Estimation of Average Derivatives in NPIV Models: Simulation Comparisons of Neural Network Estimators\n\n(Authors: Jiafeng Chen, Xiaohong Chen and Elie Tamer)\n\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06763\n(2) Neural network Inference on Nonparametric conditional moment restrictions with weakly dependent data\n\n(Authors: Xiaohong Chen, Yuan Liao and Weichen Wang).\nAbstract:\n We analyze worker reactions to their firms’ credit deterioration. Using weekly networking activity on LinkedIn, we show workers initiate more connections immediately following a negative credit event, even at firms far from bankruptcy. Our results suggest that workers are driven by concerns about both unemployment and future prospects at their firm. Heightened networking activity is associated with contemporaneous and future departures, especially at financially healthy firms. Other negative events like missed earnings and equity downgrades do not trigger similar reactions. Overall, our results indicate that the build-up of connections triggered by credit deterioration represents a source of fragility for firms.\nAbstract: \nWould Kepler have discovered his laws if machine learning had been around in 1609? Or would he have been satisfied with the accuracy of some black box regression model, leaving Newton without the inspiration to discover the law of gravitation? In this talk I will explore the compatibility of industry-oriented machine learning algorithms with discovery in the natural sciences. I will describe recent approaches developed with collaborators for addressing this, based on a strategy of “translating” neural networks into symbolic models via evolutionary algorithms. I will discuss the inner workings of the open-source symbolic regression library PySR (\ngithub.com/MilesCranmer/PySR\n), which forms a central part of this interpretable learning toolkit. Finally, I will present examples of how these methods have been used in the past two years in scientific discovery, and outline some current efforts.\nAbstract: \nLarge language models of a huge number of parameters and trained on near internet-sized number of tokens have been empirically shown to obey “neural scaling laws” for which their performance behaves predictably as a power law in either parameters or dataset size until bottlenecked by the other resource. To understand this better, we first identify the necessary properties allowing such scaling laws to arise and then propose a statistical model — a joint generative data model and random feature model — that captures this neural scaling phenomenology. By solving this model using tools from random matrix theory, we gain insight into (i) the statistical structure of datasets and tasks that lead to scaling laws (ii) how nonlinear feature maps, i.e the role played by the deep neural network, enable scaling laws when trained on these datasets, and (iii) how such scaling laws can break down, and what their behavior is when they do. A key feature is the manner in which the power laws that occur in the statistics of natural datasets are translated into power law scalings of the test loss, and how the finite extent of such power laws leads to both bottlenecks and breakdowns.\n \nFor more information, please see: https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/big-data-2022/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-big-data-conference-2022/"},

Here, we leverage quantum anomalies as a powerful nonperturbative tool to calculate optical transport in these models in the infrared limit. While the simplest such models with a single boson flavor (N=1) have zero incoherent conductivity, a recently proposed large N deformation involving flavor-random Yukawa couplings between N flavors of bosons and fermions admits a nontrivial incoherent conductivity \n (z is the boson dynamical exponent) when the order parameter is odd under inversion. The presence of incoherent conductivity in the random flavor model is a consequence of its unusual anomaly structure. From this we conclude that the large N deformation does not share important nonperturbative features with the physical N = 1 model, though it remains an interesting theory in its own right. Going beyond the IR fixed point, we also consider the effects of irrelevant operators and show, within the scope of the RPA expansion, that the old result \n  due to Kim et al. is incorrect for inversion-odd order parameters.\nFor more information on how to join, please see: \nhttps://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/quantum-matter-seminar/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-gifts-from-anomalies-new-results-on-quantum-critical-transport-in-non-fermi-liquids/"},

Many flavors of these moduli spaces have been in circulation for a while, starting with the work of Culler-Vogtmann in the 1980s on Outer Space.

We propose this setting as a test to characterise the robustness, or topologicity, of the quantum state of matter and apply our test to the Laughlin states. Laughlin states form a vector bundle, the Laughlin bundle, over the Jacobian - the space of Aharonov-Bohm fluxes through the holes of the surface. The rank of the Laughlin bundle is the degeneracy of Laughlin states or, in presence of quasiholes, the dimension of the corresponding full many-body Hilbert space; its slope, which is the first Chern class divided by the rank, is the Hall conductance. We compute the rank and all the Chern classes of Laughlin bundles for any genus and any number of quasiholes, settling, in particular, the Wen-Niu conjecture. Then we show that Laughlin bundles with non-localized quasiholes are not projectively flat and that the Hall current is precisely quantized only for the states with localized quasiholes. Hence our test distinguishes these states from the full many-body Hilbert space.Based on joint work with Dimitri Zvonkine (CNRS, University of Paris-Versaille)\n ", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-topological-quantum-matter-seminar-geometric-test-for-topological-states-of-matter/"},

This is the first invariant known to enjoy comparable bounds for indefinite manifolds W.\nThe key observation is that even when b^+(W) > 0, one can define a Donaldson invariant in the (tilde) instanton homology of boundary(W) --- not in the usual instanton tilde complex, but rather a \"suspension\". This suspension process accounts for the role of obstructed gluing theory, and does not destroy information about q_3 (but does destroy information about all other types of h-invariant).\nAs a corollary, we show that there exist integer homology spheres with arbitrary integral surgery number S(Y_n) = n. This answers a question of Dave Auckly.

Another application is a description of the link Floer complexes of algebraic links, which is parallel to Ozsvath and Szabo's description of the knot Floer complex of an L-space link. The latter application is joint with M. Borodzik and B.

Studying the quark-gluon plasma also provides a window into the earliest moments of the universe, since microseconds after the Big Bang the universe was filled with matter in the form of the quark-gluon plasma. For more than two decades, the community has intensely studied the quark-gluon plasma with the help of a rich interaction between experiments, theory, phenomenology, and numerical simulations. From these investigations, a coherent picture has emerged, indicating that the quark-gluon plasma behaves essentially like a relativistic liquid with viscosity. More recently, state-of-the-art numerical relativity simulations strongly suggested that viscous and dissipative effects can also have non-negligible effects on gravitational waves produced by binary neutron star mergers. But despite the importance of viscous effects for the study of such systems, a robust and comprehensive theory of relativistic fluids with viscosity is still lacking. This is due, in part, to difficulties to preserve causality upon the inclusion of viscous and dissipative effects into theories of relativistic fluids. In this talk, we will survey the history of the problem and report on a new approach to relativistic viscous fluids that addresses these issues.\nFor information on how to join, please see:  \nhttps://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/event_category/general-relativity/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-general-relativity-seminar-a-scale-critical-trapped-surface-formation-criterion-for-the-einstein-maxwell-system-2/"},

This conjecture, due to Igusa and Denef--Loeser, states that for every pole s of the motivic zeta function associated to f, exp(2πis) is a \"monodromy eigenvalue\" associated to f. On the other hand, the non-degeneracy condition on f ensures that the singularity theory of f is governed, up to a certain extent, by faces of the Newton polyhedron of f. The extent to which the former is governed by the latter is one key aspect of the conjecture, and will be the main focus of my talk.\nWebpage:\n \nhttps://sites.google.\ncom/view/harvardmitag", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/around-the-motivic-monodromy-conjecture-for-non-degenerate-hypersurfaces/"},

Thus, the superlattice potential provides a new route to the long sought-after goal of realizing spontaneous magnetic order on the surface of a 3D TI. In the second example, we show that a superlattice potential applied to Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene can generate flat Chern bands, similar to in twisted bilayer graphene, whose bandwidth can be as small as a few meV.

An alternative approach is to develop models whose output is a human interpretable, faithful reasoning trace leading to an answer. In this talk we will characterise faithful reasoning in terms of logically valid reasoning and demonstrate where current reasoning models fall short. Following this, we will introduce Selection-Inference, a faithful reasoning model, whose causal structure mirrors the requirements for valid reasoning.

Cliques are a natural notion of social network cohesiveness with a long history.\nA fundamental question, with many applications, is \"How fast can one list all k-cliques in a given graph?\".\nEven just detecting whether an n-vertex graph contains a k-Clique has long been known to be NP-complete when k can depend on n (and hence no efficient algorithm is likely to exist for it). If k is a small constant, such as 3 or 4 (independent of n), even the brute-force algorithm runs in polynomial time, O(n^k), and can list all k-cliques in the graph; though O(n^k) time is far from practical. As the number of k-cliques in an n-vertex graph can be Omega(n^k), the brute-force algorithm is in some sense optimal, but only if there are Omega(n^k) k-cliques. In this talk we will show how to list k-cliques faster when the input graph has few k-cliques, with running times depending on the number of vertices n, the number of edges m, the number of k-cliques T and more. We will focus on the case when k=3, but we will note some extensions.\n(Based on joint work with Andreas Bjorklund, Rasmus Pagh, Uri Zwick, Mina Dalirrooyfard, Surya Mathialagan and Yinzhan Xu)\n\n\n\n", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-colloquium-clique-listing-algorithms/"},

There is much to learn about a band insulator beyond the assertion that it has a gap separating the valence bands from the conduction bands. In the particular case of two dimensions, the occupied bands may have a nontrivial topological twist determining what is called a Chern insulator. This topological twist is not just a mathematical observation, it has observable consequences—the transverse Hall conductivity is quantized and proportional to the 1st Chern number of the vector bundle of occupied states over the Brillouin zone. Finer properties of band insulators refer not just to the topology, but also to their geometry. Of particular interest is the momentum-space quantum metric and the Berry curvature. The latter is the curvature of a connection on the vector bundle of occupied states. The study of the geometry of band insulators can also be used to probe whether the material may host stable fractional topological phases. In particular, for a Chern band to have an algebra of projected density operators which is isomorphic to the W∞ algebra found by Girvin, MacDonald and Platzman—\nthe GMP algebra\n—in the context of the fractional quantum Hall effect, certain geometric constrains, associated with the \nholomorphic\n character of the Bloch wave functions, are naturally found and they enforce a compatibility relation between the quantum metric and the Berry curvature of the band. The Brillouin zone is then endowed with a \nKähler structure\n which, in this case, is also translation-invariant (flat). Motivated by the above, we will provide an overview of the geometry of Chern insulators from the perspective of Kähler geometry, introducing the notion of a  Kähler band which shares properties with the well-known ideal case of the lowest Landau level. Furthermore, we will provide a prescription, borrowing ideas from geometric quantization, to generate a flat Kähler band in some appropriate asymptotic limit. Such flat Kähler bands are potential candidates to host and realize fractional Chern insulating phases. Using geometric quantization arguments, we then provide a natural generalization of the theory to all even dimensions.\n ", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-topological-quantum-matter-seminar-kahler-bands-chern-insulators-holomorphicity-and-induced-quantum-geometry/"},

The situation is especially interesting when the strength of the light-matter coupling Ω\nR\n is such that the coupling energy becomes close to the one of the bare matter resonance ω\n0\n. For this value of parameters, the system enters the so-called ultra-strong coupling regime, in which a number of very interesting physical effects were predicted caused by the counter-rotating and diamagnetic terms of the Hamiltonian.\nIn a microcavity, the strength of the electric field caused by the vacuum fluctuations, to which the strength of the light-matter coupling Ω\nR\nis proportional, scales inversely with the cavity volume. One very interesting feature of the circuit-based metamaterials is the fact that this volume can be scaled down to deep subwavelength values in all three dimension of space.\n1\n Using metamaterial coupled to two-dimensional electron gases under a strong applied magnetic field, we have now explored to which extend this volume can be scaled down and reached a regime where the stability of the polariton is limited by diffraction into a continuum of plasmon modes\n2\n.\nWe have also used transport to probe the ultra-strong light-matter coupling\n3\n, and show now that the latter can induce a breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect\n4\n. The phenomenon is explained in terms of cavity-assisted hopping, an anti-resonant process where an electron can scatter from one edge of the sample to the other by “borrowing” a photon from the cavity\n5\n. We are also evaluating a proposal suggesting that the value of the quantization voltage can be renormalized by the cavity\n6\n.\n \n \nFor more information on how to join, please see: \nhttps://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/event_category/topological-quantum-matter-seminar/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-topological-quantum-matter-vacuum-fluctuations-in-cavities-breakdown-of-the-topological-protection-in-the-integer-quantum-hall-effect/"},

Typically one thinks about the target measure as being 'complicated' while the source is simpler and often more structured. In such a setting, for applications, it is desirable to find Lipschitz transport maps which afford the transfer of analytic properties from the source to the target. The talk will focus on Lipschitz regularity when the target measure satisfies a log-Lipschitz condition.\nI will present a construction of a transport map, constructed infinitesimally along the Langevin flow, and explain how to analyze its Lipschitz constant.

We embed these theories in gauged non-Abelian horizontal lepton symmetries, e.g. U(1)Lμ−Lτ⊂SU(3)H, where the generalized symmetries are broken nonperturbatively by the existence of lepton family magnetic monopoles.

Out of equilibrium, no such principles apply and self organization principles are scarce. Active matter describes systems in which individual units dissipate energy to exert forces on their environment. Dissipation and injection of energy are then disconnected at the microscopic scale, hence driving the system strongly out of thermal equilibrium. This leads to a phenomenology markedly different from that of equilibrium systems, such as the emergence of dense phases in the absence of cohesive attractive forces, but it also leaves us without guiding principles to\n\nunderstand the self-organization of active matter. In this talk I will review the progress which has been made over the past ten years to control the organization of self-propelled agents using motility control, either externally or through interactions. I will show that generic principles apply and illustrate the theoretical developments presented in the talk using recent experiments on the motility-induced self-organization of bacterial mixtures.\nThis seminar will be held in person and on Zoom.

One of the most exciting developments has been the identification of 4d QFTs possessing non-invertible symmetries, i.e. global symmetries whose generators exhibit fusion rules that are not group-like. In this talk, I will discuss realizations of non-invertible symmetries in string theory and holography. As a concrete case study, I will consider the Klebanov-Strassler setup for holographic confinement in Type IIB string theory. The global symmetries of the holographic 4d QFT (both invertible and non-invertible) can be accessed by studying the topological couplings of the low-energy effective action of the dual 5d supergravity theory. Moreover, non-invertible symmetry defects can be realized in terms of D-branes. The D-brane picture captures non-trivial aspects of the fusion of non-invertible symmetry defects, and of their action on extended operators of the 4d QFT.\n \nFor more information on how to join, please see: \nhttps://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/event_category/quantum-matter-seminar/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-neutrino-masses-from-generalized-symmetry-breaking-2/"},

The effect of phase fluctuations of the pairing fields can be dealt with perturbatively using disorder averaging, after we treat the local superconducting order parameter as a static disordered background. It is then confirmed that the phase fluctuations above the 2d Berenzinskii-Kosterlitz-\nThouless (BKT) transition give birth to the pseudogap phenomenon, leading to a significant broadening of the single-particle spectral functions. Quantitatively, the broadening of the spectral weights at the BCS gap is characterized by the ratio of the superconducting coherence length and the spatial correlation length of the superconducting pairing order parameter. Our results are tested on the attractive-U fermion Hubbard model on the square lattice, using unbiased determinant quantum Monte Carlo method and stochastic analytic continuation. We also apply our method to 2d superconductors with d-wave pairing and observe that the phase fluctuations may lead to Fermi-arc phenomenon above the BKT transition.\nFor more information on how to join, please see: \nCMSA quantum matter in mathematics and physics", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-fluctuations-in-two-dimensional-superconductors-and-pseudogap-phenomenon/"},

Klebanov - Princeton University", "text": "Quantum many-body scars have been an active area of research in Condensed Matter Physics for several years. In some many-body systems, the Hilbert space breaks up into a large ergodic sector and a much smaller scar subspace. It has been suggested [K. Pakrouski et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 (2020) 230602] that the two sectors may be distinguished by their transformation properties under a large group whose rank grows with the system size (this group is not a symmetry of the Hamiltonian). The scars are invariant under this group, while all other states are not. We begin by reviewing some many-body systems where group singlet states have special properties: the matrix quantum mechanics and fermionic tensor models. We continue on to appropriately deformed versions of the SU(2) Hubbard model and show that the scar subsector is invariant under a large group, which acts on the lattice sites. More generally, we apply this idea to lattice systems with N sites that contain M Majorana fermions per site. The Hilbert space may be decomposed under the action of the SO(N)xSO(M) group, and the scars are the SO(N) singlets. For any even M, there are two families of scars. One of them, which we call the eta-states, is symmetric under the group O(N) that includes a reflection. The other, the zeta-states, has the SO(N) invariance only. For M=4, where our construction reduces to a deformed SU(2) Hubbard chain with local interactions, the former family are the N+1 eta-pairing states, while the latter are the N+1 states of maximum spin. For M=6, we exhibit explicit formulae for the scar states and calculate the bipartite entanglement entropy analytically. For large N, it grows logarithmically with the region size. In general, the energies of the scars within each family are not equidistant. For M>6 we also find that, with local Hamiltonians, the scars typically have certain degeneracies.\nThe latter part of the talk is based on the recent paper “Majorana Scars as Group Singlets” by Zimo Sun, Fedor Popov, Igor Klebanov and Kiryl Pakrouski, arXiv:2212.11914\nFor more information on how to join, please see: \nhttps://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/event_category/quantum-matter-seminar/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-reflections-on-parity-breaking-2/"},

In this work, we present some insights (and many further mysteries) through the lens of automata and their algebraic structure.\nSpecifically, we investigate the apparent mismatch between recurrent models of computation (automata & Turing machines) and Transformers (which are typically shallow and non-recurrent). Using tools from circuit complexity and semigroup theory, we characterize shortcut solutions, whereby a shallow Transformer with only o(T) layers can exactly replicate T computational steps of an automaton. We show that Transformers can efficiently represent these shortcuts in theory; furthermore, in synthetic experiments, standard training successfully finds these shortcuts.

Oszváth and Z. Szabó in the early 2000s. Because of its relative computability by the standards of gauge and Floer theoretic invariants, it has enjoyed considerably popularity. However, it is not immediately obvious from the construction that Heegaard Floer homology is natural, that is, that it assigns to a basepointed 3-manifold a well-defined module over an appropriate base ring rather than an isomorphism class of modules, and well-defined cobordism maps to 4-manifolds with boundary. This situation was improved in the 2010s when A. Juhász, D. Thurston, and I. Zemke showed naturality of the various versions of Heegaard Floer homology. In this talk we consider involutive Heegaard Floer homology, a refinement of the theory introduced by C. Manolescu and I in 2015, whose definition relies on Juhász-Thurston-Zemke naturality but which is itself not obviously natural even given their results. We prove that involutive Heegaard Floer homology is a natural invariant of basepointed 3-manifolds together with a framing of the basepoint, and has well-defined maps associated to cobordisms, and discuss some consequences and implications.

Whitney’s work in the early 1930s (Whitney (1992)), and finally has been answered in recent years by C. Fefferman’s works (Fefferman, 2006, 2005). The solution to the Whitney extension problem leads to new insights for data interpolation and inspires the formulation of the Geometric Whitney Problems (Fefferman et al. (2020, 2021a)): Assume that we are given a set $Y \\subset \\mathbb{R}^D$. When can we construct a smooth $d$-dimensional submanifold $\\widehat{M} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^D$ to approximate $Y$, and how well can $\\widehat{M}$ estimate $Y$ in terms of distance and smoothness? To address these problems, various mathematical approaches have been proposed (see Fefferman et al. (2016, 2018, 2021b)). However, many of these methods rely on restrictive assumptions, making extending them to efficient and workable algorithms challenging. As the manifold hypothesis (non-Euclidean structure exploration) continues to be a foundational element in statistics, the manifold fitting Problem, merits further exploration and discussion within the modern statistical community.

In the classical setup, a linear subspace V of an n-dimensional vector space gives rise to a matroid M(V) on {1,…,n}. However, the matroid M(V) also knows about some nonlinear geometric spaces related to V. Conversely, those nonlinear spaces teach us things we didn’t know about matroids. My talk will discuss some examples.\nAbstract:\n Algebraic geometry has furnished fruitful tools for studying matroids, which are combinatorial abstractions of hyperplane arrangements. We first survey some recent developments, pointing out how these developments remained partially disjoint. We then introduce certain vector bundles (K-classes) on permutohedral varieties, which we call “tautological bundles (classes)” of matroids, as a new framework that unifies, recovers, and extends these recent developments. Our framework leads to new questions that further probe the boundary between combinatorics and geometry. Joint work with Andrew Berget, Hunter Spink, and Dennis Tseng.\nAbstract: \nThe associahedron is known to encapsulate physical properties such as the notion of tree-level factorization for one of the simplest Quantum Field Theories, the biadjoint scalar, which has only cubic interactions.  I will discuss novel instances of the associahedron and the biadjoint scalar in a class of generalized amplitudes, discovered by Cachazo, Early, Guevara and Mizera, by taking certain limits thereof. This connection leads to a simple proof of a new realization of the associahedron involving a Minkowski sum of certain positroid polytopes in the second hypersimplex.\nAbstract: \nI will talk about work to uncover connections between invariant theory and maximum likelihood estimation. I will describe how norm minimization over a torus orbit is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation in log-linear models. We will see the role played by polytopes and discuss connections to scaling algorithms. Based on joint work with Carlos Améndola, Kathlén Kohn, and Philipp Reichenbach.\nAbstract:\n In this talk I will discuss about \nAmplituhedra\n – generalizations of polytopes inside the Grassmannian – introduced by physicists to encode interactions of elementary particles in certain Quantum Field Theories. In particular, I will explain how the problem of finding triangulations of Amplituhedra is connected to computing scattering amplitudes of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory.\n\nTriangulations of polygons are encoded in the \nassociahedron\n, studied by Stasheff in the sixties; in the case of polytopes, triangulations are captured by \nsecondary polytopes\n, constructed by Gelfand et al. in the nineties. Whereas a “secondary” geometry describing triangulations of Amplituhedra is still not known, and we pave the way for such studies. I will discuss how the combinatorics of triangulations interplays with T-duality from String Theory, in connection with the \nMomentum Amplituhedron\n. A generalization of T-duality led us to discover a striking duality between Amplituhedra of “m=2” type and a seemingly unrelated object – the \nHypersimplex\n. The latter is a polytope which appears in many contexts, from matroid theory to tropical geometry.\n\nBased on joint works with Lauren Williams, Melissa Sherman-Bennett, Tomasz Lukowski.\nAbstract:\n In this talk, I’ll continue where Matteo left off. I’ll give some more details about the curious correspondence between the m=2 amplituhedron, a 2k-dimensional subset of Gr(k, k+2), and the hypersimplex, an (n-1)-dimensional polytope in R^n. The amplituhedron and hypersimplex are both images of the totally nonnegative Grassmannian under some map (the amplituhedron map and the moment map, respectively), but are different dimensions and live in very different ambient spaces. I’ll talk about joint work with Matteo Parisi and Lauren Williams in which we give a bijection between decompositions of the amplituhedron and decompositions of the hypersimplex (originally conjectured by Lukowski–Parisi–Williams). The hypersimplex decompositions are closely related to matroidal subdivisions. Along the way, we prove a nice description of the m=2 amplituhedron conjectured by Arkani-Hamed–Thomas–Trnka and give a new decomposition of the m=2 amplituhedron into Eulerian-number-many chambers, inspired by an analogous triangulation of the hypersimplex into Eulerian-number-many simplices.\n \nThursday, April 28, 2022\nAbstract:\n Feynman integrals play a central role in particle physics in the theory of scattering amplitudes. They form a finite-dimensional vector space and the elements of a basis are named “master integrals” in the physics literature. The number of master integrals has been interpreted in different ways: it equals the dimension of a twisted de Rham cohomology group, the Euler characteristic of a very affine variety, and the holonomic rank of a D-module. In this talk, we are interested in a more general family of integrals that contains Feynman integrals as a special case. We explore this setting using tools coming from nonlinear algebra. This is an ongoing project with Daniele Agostini, Anna-Laura Sattelberger, and Simon Telen.\nAbstract: \nThe Landau discriminant is a projective variety containing kinematic parameters for which a Feynman integral can have singularities. We present a definition and geometric properties. We discuss how to compute Landau discriminants using symbolic and numerical methods. Our methods can be used, for instance, to compute the Landau discriminant of the pentabox diagram, which is a degree 12 hypersurface in 6-space. This is joint work with Sebastian Mizera.\nAbstract: \nBruhat interval polytopes are a well-studied class of generalized permutohedra which arise as moment map images of various toric varieties and totally positive spaces in the flag variety. I will describe work in progress in which I study the 1-skeleta of these polytopes, viewed as posets interpolating between weak order and Bruhat order. In many cases these posets are lattices and the polytopes, despite not being simple, have interesting h-vectors. In a special case, work of Williams shows that Bruhat interval polytopes are isomorphic to \nbridge polytopes\n, so that chains in the 1-skeleton poset correspond to BCFW-bridge decompositions of plabic graphs.\nAbstract:\n I will discuss a recent project in computing the top weight cohomology of the moduli space $A_g$ of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $g$ for small values of $g$. This piece of the cohomology is controlled by the combinatorics of the boundary strata of a compactification of $A_g$. Thus, it can be computed combinatorially. This is joint work with Juliette Bruce, Melody Chan, Margarida Melo, Gwyneth Moreland, and Corey Wolfe.\nAbstract:\n We start with an overview of the correspondence between spectral curves and commutative rings of differential operators, integrable hierarchies of non-linear PDEs and Jacobian vector fields. The coefficients of the operators can be written explicitly in terms of the Kleinian sigma function: Weierstrass’ sigma function was generalized to genus greater than one by Klein, and is a ubiquitous tool in integrability. The most accessible case is the sigma function of telescopic curves. In joint work with J. Komeda and S. Matsutani, we construct a curve with non-symmetric Weierstrass semigroup (equivalently, Young tableau), consequently non-telescopic, and its sigma function. We conclude with possible applications to commutative rings of differential operators.\n \nFriday, April 29, 2022\nAbstract:\n It is well-known that soliton solutions of the KdV hierarchy are obtained by singular limits of hyper-elliptic curves. However, there is no general results for soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy, KP solitons. In this talk, I will show that some of the KP solitons are related to the singular space curves associated with certain class of numerical semigroups.\nAbstract:\n The Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation is a differential equation whose study yields interesting connections between integrable systems and algebraic geometry. In this talk I will discuss solutions to the KP equation whose underlying algebraic curves undergo tropical degenerations. In these cases, Riemann’s theta function becomes a finite exponential sum that is supported on a Delaunay polytope. I will introduce the Hirota variety which parametrizes all KP solutions arising from such a sum. I will then discuss a special case, studying the Hirota variety of a rational nodal curve. Of particular interest is an irreducible subvariety that is the image of a parameterization map. Proving that this is a component of the Hirota variety entails solving a weak Schottky problem for rational nodal curves. This talk is based on joint work with Daniele Agostini, Claudia Fevola, and Bernd Sturmfels.\nAbstract:\n In this talk, we will give an overview of the problem of finding the centralizer of a fixed differential operator in a ring of differential operators, along with connections to integrable hierarchies and soliton solutions to e.g. the KdV or KP equations. Given these interesting connections, it is important to be able to compute centralizers of differential operators, and we discuss how to use techniques from differential algebra to approach this question, as well as how having these computational tools can help in understanding the structure of soliton solutions to these equations.\nAbstract:\n I will give an introduction to a class of polytopes that recently emerged in the study of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/workshop-on-nonlinear-algebra-and-combinatorics-from-physics/"},

While encryption can secure data both in transit and at rest, in the new era of ubiquitous computing, modern cryptography also aims to protect data during computation. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a powerful technology to tackle this problem, which enables distrustful parties to jointly perform computation over their private data without revealing their data to each other. Although it is theoretically feasible and provably secure, the adoption of MPC in real industry is still very much limited as of today, the biggest obstacle of which boils down to its efficiency.\nMy research goal is to bridge the gap between the theoretical feasibility and practical efficiency of MPC. Towards this goal, my research spans both theoretical and applied cryptography. In theory, I develop new techniques for achieving general MPC with the optimal complexity, bringing theory closer to practice. In practice, I design tailored MPC to achieve the best concrete efficiency for specific real-world applications. In this talk, I will discuss the challenges in both directions and how to overcome these challenges using cryptographic approaches. I will also show strong connections between theory and practice.\nFor information on how to join, please see:  https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/seminars-and-colloquium/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-interdisciplinary-science-seminar-secure-multi-party-computation-from-theory-to-practice/"},

However, such a charge condensate seems subtle and is sometimes described as the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry (or a global subgroup). In this talk, I will argue that the Higgs phase is best understood as a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. The concept of SPT phases arose out of the condensed matter community, to describe systems with short-range entanglement and edge modes which cannot be removed in the presence of certain symmetries. The perspective that the Higgs phase is an SPT phase recovers known properties of the Higgs phase and provides new insights. In particular, we revisit the Fradkin-Shenker model and the distinction between the Higgs and confined phases of a gauge theory.\nFor information on how to join, please see:  https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/seminars-and-colloquium/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-higgs-spt/"},

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to upsample and downsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/99651364593?pwd=Q1R0RTMrZ2NZQjg1U1ZOaUYzSE02QT09", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-new-technologies-in-mathematics-seminar-why-abstraction-is-the-key-to-intelligence-and-what-were-still-missing-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2/"},

The first has fermionic charges and bosonic Z2 gauge flux loops (FcBl) and is just the ordinary fermionic toric code.

Here, we will see the crucial role of complexity-theoretic methods in progress on the `area law conjecture' and in the development of efficient algorithms to classically simulate quantum many-body systems.\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/99651364593?pwd=Q1R0RTMrZ2NZQjg1U1ZOaUYzSE02QT09", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-new-technologies-in-mathematics-seminar-why-abstraction-is-the-key-to-intelligence-and-what-were-still-missing-2-2-2-3/"},

In particular, this provides PL isometric embeddings for every flat torus (a quotient of E² by a rank 2 lattice). However, the proof of Burago and Zalgaller is partially constructive, relying on the Nash-Kuiper theorem. In practice, it produces PL embeddings with a huge number of vertices, moreover distinct for every flat torus.

At each timestep, an agent has to choose an action, then receives a reward, and then the agent’s environment changes (deterministically or stochastically) in response to the agent’s action. The agent’s goal is to adjust its actions to maximize its total reward. In principle, the optimal behavior can be obtained by dynamic programming or optimal control techniques, although practice is another story.\nHere we consider a more complex problem: learn all optimal behaviors for all possible reward functions in a given environment. Ideally, such a “controllable agent” could be given a description of a task (reward function, such as “you get +10 for reaching here but -1 for going through there”) and immediately perform the optimal behavior for that task. This requires a good understanding of the mapping from a reward function to the associated optimal behavior.\nWe prove that there exists a particular “map” of a Markov decision process, on which near-optimal behaviors for all reward functions can be read directly by an algebraic formula. Moreover, this “map” is learnable by standard deep learning techniques from random interactions with the environment. We will present our recent theoretical and empirical results in this direction.\nZoom ID: 950 2372 5230 (Password: cmsa)", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-markov-chains-optimal-control-and-reinforcement-learning/"},

This resolves the paradox, but opposition to this resolution came from groups who sought to extrapolate some ideas in holography. In 2009 it was shown, using some theorems from quantum information theory, that these extrapolations were incorrect, and the fuzzball structure was essential for resolving the puzzle. Opposition continued along different lines, with a postulate that information would leak out through wormholes.

There are many examples of mathematicians pioneering new technologies to aid our understanding of the mathematical world: using very early computers to help formulate the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and using computer aid to prove the four colour theorem are among the most notable. Up until now there hasn’t been significant use of machine learning in the field and it hasn’t been clear where it might be useful for the questions that mathematicians care about. In this talk we will discuss the results of our recent Nature paper, where we worked together with top mathematicians to use machine learning to achieve two new results - proving a new connection between the hyperbolic and geometric structure of knots, and conjecturing a resolution to a 50-year problem in representation theory, the combinatorial invariance conjecture. Through these examples we demonstrate a way that machine learning can be used by mathematicians to help guide the development of surprising and beautiful new conjectures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/new-technologies-in-mathematics-machine-learning-with-mathematicians/"},

Associated with a given hyperbolic metric is a sequence of numbers corresponding to the discrete eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. While these eigenvalues usually cannot be calculated exactly, they can be found numerically and must also satisfy various bounds. In this talk, I will discuss a new approach for finding numerical bounds on the eigenvalues of closed hyperbolic manifolds using general consistency conditions and semidefinite programming, inspired by the approach of the conformal bootstrap from physics. Although these bootstrap bounds follow from seemingly trivial consistency conditions, they are surprisingly strong and are sometimes almost saturated by actual manifolds; for example, one such bound implies that the first nonzero eigenvalue of a closed hyperbolic surface must be less than 3.83890, and this is very close to being saturated by a particular genus-2 surface called the Bolza surface. I will show how to derive this and other bounds and will discuss some possible future directions for this approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/\n99651364593?pwd=\nQ1R0RTMrZ2NZQjg1U1ZOaUYzSE02QT\n09\n\n\nPassword: cmsa\n\n\n\n\n\n", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-new-technologies-in-mathematics-bootstrapping-hyperbolic-manifolds/"},

Mixture of transition distribution models (MTD)  were introduced to overcome both limitations. MTD represent higher order Markov models as a convex mixture of single step Markov chains, reducing the number of parameters and increasing the interpretability. Nevertheless, in practice, estimation of MTD models with large orders are still limited because of curse of dimensionality and high algorithm complexity. Here, we prove that if only few lags are relevant we can consistently and efficiently recover the lags and estimate the transition probabilities of high order MTD models. Furthermore, we show that using the selected lags we can construct non-asymptotic confidence intervals for the transition probabilities of the model. The key innovation is a recursive procedure for the selection of the relevant lags of the model.  Our results are  based on (1) a new structural result of the MTD and (2) an improved martingale concentration inequality.

In this work we prove there is at most one non-trivial fixed point for Ising models with zero and certain random external fields.\nAs a concrete example, consider a sample A of Ising model on a rooted tree (regular, Galton-Watson, etc). Let B be a noisy version of A obtained by independently perturbing each spin as follows: Bv equals to Av with some small probability δ and otherwise taken to be a uniform +-1 (alternatively, 0). We show that the distribution of the root spin Aρ conditioned on values Bv of all vertices v at a large distance from the root is independent of δ and coincides with δ=0. Previously this was only known for sufficiently low-temperature'' models. Our proof consists of constructing a metric under which the BP operator is a contraction (albeit non-multiplicative). I hope to convince you our proof is technically rather simple.\nThis simultaneously closes the following 5 conjectures in the literature: uselessness of global information for a labeled 2-community stochastic block model, or 2-SBM (Kanade-Mossel-Schramm'2014); optimality of local algorithms for 2-SBM under noisy side information (Mossel-Xu'2015); independence of robust reconstruction accuracy to leaf noise in broadcasting on trees (Mossel-Neeman-Sly'2016); boundary irrelevance in BOT (Abbe-Cornacchia-Gu-P.'2021); characterization of entropy of community labels given the graph in 2-SBM (ibid).\nJoint work with Qian Yu (Princeton).\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/779283357?pwd=MitXVm1pYUlJVzZqT3lwV2pCT1ZUQT09", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/math-picture-language-seminar-uniqueness-of-bp-fixed-point-for-ising-models/"},

We show that they suffer from a gravitational anomaly that breaks a chiral U(1) symmetry specific to Kaehler-Dirac fermions down to Z_4 in any even dimension. In odd dimensions we show that the effective theory that results from integrating out massive Kaehler-Dirac fermions is a topological gravity theory. Such theories generalize Witten's construction of (2+1) gravity as a Chern Simons theory. In the presence of a domain wall massless modes appear on the wall which can be consistently coupled to gravity due to anomaly inflow from the bulk gravitational theory. Much of this story parallels the usual discussion of topological insulators. The key difference is that the twisted chiral symmetry and anomaly structure of Kaehler-Dirac theories survives intact under discretization and governs the behavior of the lattice models. $Z_4$ invariant four fermion interactions can be used to gap out states in such theories without breaking symmetries and in flat space yields the known constraints on the number of Majorana fermions needed symmetric mass generation namely eight and sixteen Majorana spinors in two and four dimensions.\nFor information on how to join, please see:  https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/seminars-and-colloquium/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-anomalies-topological-insulators-and-kaehler-dirac-fermions/"},

Unfortunately, they did not give a direct mathematical definition of their BPS invariants, but they predicted that they are related to the Gromov-Witten invariants by a transformation of the generating series. The Gopakumar-Vafa conjecture asserts that if one defines the BPS invariants indirectly through this procedure, then they satisfy an integrality and a (genus) finiteness condition.\n \nThe integrality conjecture has been resolved by Ionel and Parker. A key innovation of their proof is the introduction of the cluster formalism: an ingenious device to side-step questions regarding multiple covers and super-rigidity. Their argument could not resolve the finiteness conjecture, however. The reason for this is that it relies on Gromov’s compactness theorem for pseudo-holomorphic maps which requires an a priori genus bound.

The stability of the family of Kerr black holes under the evolution generated by the Einstein equation is a long-standing problem in mathematical relativity. In 1972, Teukolsky discovered equations governing certain components of the linearised curvature that are invariant under linearised gague transformations. In 1975, Chrzanowski introduced the “outgoing radiation gauge”, a condition on the linearised metric that allows for the construction of the linearised metric from the linearised curvature. In 2019, we proved decay for the metric constructed using Chrzanowski’s outgoing radiation gauge. Recently, using a flow along null geodesics, we have constructed a new gauge such that, in this gauge, the Einstein equation is well posed and such that the linearisation is Chrzanowski’s outgoing radiation gauge.\nThis is joint work with Lars Andersson, Thomas Backdahl, and Siyuan Ma.\nAbstract: \nThe Kerr-de Sitter metric describes a rotating black hole with mass $m$ and specific angular momentum $a$ in a universe, such as our own, with cosmological constant $\\Lambda>0$. I will explain a proof of mode stability for the scalar wave equation on Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes in the following setting: fixing $\\Lambda$ and the ratio $|a/m|<1$ (related to the subextremality of the black hole in question), mode stability holds for sufficiently small black hole mass $m$. We also obtain estimates for the location of quasinormal modes (resonances) $\\sigma$ in any fixed half space $\\Im\\sigma>-C$. Our results imply that solutions of the wave equation decay exponentially in time to constants, with an explicit exponential rate. The proof is based on careful uniform estimates for the spectral family in the singular limit $m\\to 0$ in which, depending on the scaling, the Kerr-de Sitter spacetime limits to a Kerr or the de Sitter spacetime.\nAbstract:\n Gravitational instantons are Ricci flat complete Riemannian 4-manifolds with at least quadratic curvature decay. In this talk, I will introduce some notions of special geometry, discuss known examples, and mention some open questions. The Chen-Teo gravitational instanton is an asymptotically flat, toric, Ricci flat family of metrics on $\\mathrm{CP}^2 \\setminus \\mathrm{S}^1$, that provides a counterexample to the classical Euclidean Black Hole Uniqueness conjecture. I will sketch a proof that the Chen-Teo Instanton is Hermitian and non-Kähler. Thus, all known examples of gravitational instantons are Hermitian. This talks is based on joint work with Steffen Aksteiner, cf. \nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11863\n.\nAbstract:\n I will present a theorem on the full finite codimension nonlinear asymptotic stability of the Schwarzschild family of black holes.  The proof employs a double null gauge, is expressed entirely in physical space, and utilises the analysis of Dafermos–Holzegel–Rodnianski on the linear stability of the Schwarzschild family.  This is joint work with M. Dafermos, G. Holzegel and I. Rodnianski.\nThis is based on joint work with Jordan Keller, Mu-Tao Wang, Ye-Kai Wang, and Shing-Tung Yau.\nAbstract: \nWe will discuss the problem of stability for the rigidity part of the Riemannian positive mass theorem, focusing on recent work with Kazaras and Khuri, in which we proved that if one assumes a lower Ricci curvature bound, then stability holds with respect to pointed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence.\n \nTuesday, April 5, 2022\nAbstract: \nBlack holes are predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, and now we have ample observational evidence for their existence. However theoretically there are many unanswered questions about how black holes come into being and about the structures of their inner spacetime singularities. In this talk, we will present several results in these directions. First, in a joint work with Qing Han, with tools from scale-critical hyperbolic method and non-perturbative elliptic techniques, with anisotropic characteristic initial data we prove that: in the process of gravitational collapse, a smooth and spacelike apparent horizon (dynamical horizon) emerges from general (both isotropic and anisotropic) initial data. This result extends the 2008 Christodoulou’s monumental work and it connects to black hole thermodynamics along the apparent horizon. Second, in joint works with Dejan Gajic and Ruixiang Zhang, for the spherically symmetric Einstein-scalar field system, we derive precise blow-up rates for various geometric quantities along the inner spacelike singularities. These rates obey polynomial blow-up upper bounds; and when it is close to timelike infinity, these rates are not limited to discrete finite choices and they are related to the Price’s law along the event horizon. This indicates a new blow-up phenomenon, driven by a PDE mechanism, rather than an ODE mechanism. If time permits, some results on fluid dynamics will also be addressed.\nAbstract:\n I will talk about the status of the stability of Kerr conjecture in General Relativity based on recent results obtained in collaboration with Jeremie Szeftel and Elena Giorgi.\nAbstract: I will talk about joint work with L. Zhang on deriving the late time dynamics of the spin $s$ components that satisfy the Teukolsky master equation in Kerr spacetimes.\nAbstract:\n Motivated by the strong cosmic censorship conjecture, we introduce a general method for understanding the late-time tail for solutions to wave equations on asymptotically flat spacetimes in odd spatial dimensions. A particular consequence of the method is a re-proof of Price’s law-type results, which concern the sharp decay rate of the late-time tails on stationary spacetimes. Moreover, we show that the late-time tails are in general different from the stationary case in the presence of dynamical and/or nonlinear perturbations. This is a joint work with Sung-Jin Oh (Berkeley).\nAbstract:\n I describe a family of four-dimensional, asymptotically flat, charged black holes that develop (charged) scalar hair as one increases their charge at fixed mass. Surprisingly, the maximum charge for given mass is a nonsingular hairy black hole with a nondegenerate event horizon. Since the surface gravity is nonzero, if quantum matter is added, Hawking radiation does not appear to stop when this new extremal limit is reached. This raises the question of whether Hawking radiation will cause the black hole to turn into a naked singularity. I will argue that does not occur.\nAbstract:\n Studies of gravitational waves have been devoted mostly to sources such as binary black hole mergers or neutron star mergers, or generally sources that are stationary outside of a compact set. These systems are described by asymptotically-flat manifolds solving the Einstein equations with sufficiently fast decay of the gravitational field towards Minkowski spacetime far away from the source. Waves from such sources have been recorded by the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration since 2015. In this talk, I will present new results on gravitational radiation for sources that are not stationary outside of a compact set, but whose gravitational fields decay more slowly towards infinity. A panorama of new gravitational effects opens up when delving deeper into these more general spacetimes. In particular, whereas the former sources produce memory effects that are finite and of purely electric parity, the latter in addition generate memory of magnetic type, and both types grow. These new effects emerge naturally from the Einstein equations both in the Einstein vacuum case and for neutrino radiation. The latter results are important for sources with extended neutrino halos.\n \nWednesday, April 6, 2022\nAbstract: Asymptotically Euclidean initial data sets $(M,g,K)$ are characterized by the existence of asymptotic coordinates in which the Riemannian metric $g$ and second fundamental form $K$ decay to the Euclidean metric $\\delta$ and to $0$ suitably fast, respectively. Provided their matter densities satisfy suitable integrability conditions, they have well-defined (ADM-)energy, (ADM-)linear momentum, and (ADM-)mass. This was proven by Bartnik using harmonic coordinates. To study their (ADM-)angular momentum and (BORT-)center of mass, one usually assumes the existence of Regge—Teitelboim coordinates on the initial data set $(M,g,K)$ in question. We will give examples of asymptotically Euclidean initial data sets which do not possess any Regge—Teitelboim coordinates We will also show that harmonic coordinates can be used as a tool in checking whether a given asymptotically Euclidean initial data set possesses Regge—Teitelboim coordinates. This is joint work with Melanie Graf and Jan Metzger. We will also explain the consequences these findings have for the definition of the center of mass, relying on joint work with Nerz and with Sakovich.\nAbstract:\n We will present results regarding the asymptotics of scalar perturbations on black hole backgrounds. We will then derive observational signatures for extremal black holes that are based on global or localized measurements on null infinity. This is based on joint work with Gajic-Angelopoulos and ongoing work with Khanna-Sabharwal.\nAbstract: \nIn the last two decades, there have been dramatic advances in the rigorous mathematical theory of shock waves in solutions to the relativistic Euler equations and their non-relativistic analog, the compressible Euler equations. A lot of the progress has relied on techniques that were developed to study Einstein’s equations. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the field and highlight some recent progress on problems without symmetry or irrotationality assumptions. I will focus on results that reveal various aspects of the structure of the maximal development of the data and the corresponding implications for the shock development problem, which is the problem of continuing the solution weakly after a shock. I will also describe various open problems, some of which are tied to the Einstein–Euler equations. Various aspects of this program are joint with L. Abbrescia, M. Disconzi, and J. Luk.\nAbstract: \nWe introduce the concept of improvability of the dominant energy scalar, and we derive strong consequences of non-improvability. In particular, we prove that a non-improvable initial data set without local symmetries must sit inside a null perfect fluid spacetime carrying a global Killing vector field. We also show that the dominant energy scalar is always almost improvable in a precise sense. Using these main results, we provide a characterization of Bartnik mass minimizing initial data sets which makes substantial progress toward Bartnik’s stationary conjecture.\nAlong the way we observe that in dimensions greater than eight there exist pp-wave counterexamples (without the optimal decay rate for asymptotically flatness) to the equality case of the spacetime positive mass theorem. As a consequence, we find counterexamples to Bartnik’s stationary and strict positivity conjectures in those dimensions. This talk is based on joint work with Dan A. Lee.\nAbstract: \nComparison theorems are the basis for our geometric understanding of Riemannian manifolds satisfying a given curvature condition. A remarkable example is the Gromov-Lawson toric band inequality, which bounds the distance between the two sides of a Riemannian torus-cross-interval with positive scalar curvature by a sharp constant inversely proportional to the scalar curvature’s minimum. We will give a new qualitative version of this and similar band-type inequalities in dimension 3 using the notion of spacetime harmonic functions, which recently played the lead role in our recent proof of the positive mass theorem. This is joint work with Sven Hirsch, Marcus Khuri, and Yiyue Zhang.\n \nThursday, April 7, 2022\nAbstract: \n“Maskit gluing” is a gluing construction for asymptotically locally hyperbolic (ALH) manifolds with negative cosmological constant. I will present a formula for the mass of Maskit-glued ALH manifolds and describe how it can be used to construct general relativistic initial data with negative mass.\nAbstract: \n We present a result from our work with Michael Eichmair and Abraão Mendes concerning initial data rigidity results (CMP, 2021), and look at some consequences.  In a note with Piotr Chruściel (CQG 2021), we showed how to use this result, together with arguments from Chruściel and Delay’s proof of the their hyperbolic PMT result, to obtain a hyperbolic PMT result with boundary.  This will also be discussed.\nAbstract:\n In the first part of this talk, I will describe how to detect the mass of asymptotically flat and asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds via large Riemannian polyhedra. In the second part, I will discuss an estimate of the Bartnik quasi-local mass and its geometric implications. This talk is based on several joint works with A. Piubello, and with H.C. Jang.\nAbstract:\n We will start with an introduction to the problem of constructing naked singularities for the Einstein vacuum equations, and then explain our discovery of a fundamentally new type of self-similarity and show how this allows us to construct solutions corresponding to a naked singularity. This is joint work with Igor Rodnianski.\nAbstract:\n The discovery of the quark-gluon plasma that forms in heavy-ion collision experiments provides a unique opportunity to study the properties of matter under extreme conditions, as the quark-gluon plasma is the hottest, smallest, and densest fluid known to humanity. Studying the quark-gluon plasma also provides a window into the earliest moments of the universe, since microseconds after the Big Bang the universe was filled with matter in the form of the quark-gluon plasma. For more than two decades, the community has intensely studied the quark-gluon plasma with the help of a rich interaction between experiments, theory, phenomenology, and numerical simulations. From these investigations, a coherent picture has emerged, indicating that the quark-gluon plasma behaves essentially like a relativistic liquid with viscosity. More recently, state-of-the-art numerical simulations strongly suggested that viscous and dissipative effects can also have non-negligible effects on gravitational waves produced by binary neutron star mergers. But despite the importance of viscous effects for the study of such systems, a robust and mathematically sound theory of relativistic fluids with viscosity is still lacking. This is due, in part, to difficulties to preserve causality upon the inclusion of viscous and dissipative effects into theories of relativistic fluids. In this talk, we will survey the history of the problem and report on a new approach to relativistic viscous fluids that addresses these issues.\nAbstract: \nWhat is inside a dynamical black hole? While the local region near time-like infinity is understood for various models, the global structure of the black hole interior has largely remained unexplored.\n\nThese questions are deeply connected to the nature of singularities in General Relativity and celebrated problems such as Penrose’s Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture.\n\nI will present my recent resolution of these problems in spherical gravitational collapse, based on the discovery of a novel phenomenon: the breakdown of weak singularities and the dynamical formation of a strong singularity.\n \nFriday, April 8, 2022\nAbstract:\n This talk accompanies Po-Ning Chen’s talk on Monday with the results described in the double null gauge rather than Bondi-Sachs coordinates. Besides discussing\n\nhow Chen-Wang-Yau angular momentum resolves the supertranslation ambiguity, we also review the definition of angular momentum defined by A. Rizzi. The talk is based on the joint work with Po-Ning Chen, Jordan Keller, Mu-Tao Wang, and Shing-Tung Yau.\nAbstract: Spacetimes with compact directions which have special holonomy, such as Calabi-Yau spaces, play an important role in\n\nsupergravity and string theory. In this talk I will discuss a recent work with Lars Andersson, Pieter Blue and Shing-Tung Yau, where we show the global, nonlinear stability a spacetime which is a cartesian product of a high dimensional Minkowski space with a compact Ricci flat internal space with special holonomy. This stability result is related to a conjecture of Penrose concerning the validity of string theory. Our proof uses the intersection of methods for quasilinear wave and Klein-Gordon equations, and so towards the end of the talk I will also comment more generally on coupled wave–Klein-Gordon equations.\nAbstract: Black hole solutions in General Relativity are parametrized by their mass, spin and charge. In this talk, I will motivate why the charge of black holes adds interesting dynamics to solutions of the Einstein equation thanks to the interaction between gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. Such radiations are solutions of a system of coupled wave equations with a symmetric structure which allows to define a combined energy-momentum tensor for the system. Finally, I will show how this physical-space approach is resolutive in the most general case of Kerr-Newman black hole, where the interaction between the radiations prevents the separability in modes.\nAbstract:\n  I will talk about a small corner of the study of Positive Scalar Curvature (PSC) and questions which are most closely related to the Positive Mass Theorem. The classic questions are ”which topologies allow for PSC?” and ”what is the geometry of manifolds with PSC?”. This is based on joint work with Prof. S-T. Yau, Prof. D. A. Lee, and R. Unger.\nAbstract:\n In the presence of confinement, the Einstein field equations are expected to exhibit turbulent dynamics. In the presence of a negative cosmological constant, the AdS instability conjecture claims the existence of arbitrarily small perturbations to the initial data of Anti-de Sitter spacetime which, under evolution by the vacuum Einstein equations with reflecting boundary conditions at conformal infinity, lead to the formation of black holes after sufficiently long time.\n\nIn this talk, I will present a rigorous proof of the AdS instability conjecture in the setting of the spherically symmetric Einstein-scalar field system. The construction of the unstable initial data will require carefully designing a family of initial configurations of localized matter beams and estimating the exchange of energy taking place between interacting beams over long periods of time, as well as estimating the decoherence rate of those beams.\n \nFor the full schedule, please see: https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/gr-program/\nThis conference will be held virtually on Zoom.

This power-law relationship of variance to mean is known as a power variance function in statistics, as Taylor's law in ecology, and as fluctuation scaling in physics and financial mathematics. This survey talk will emphasize ideas, motivations, recent theoretical results, and applications rather than detailed proofs. Many models intended to explain Taylor's law assume the probability distribution underlying each sample has finite mean and variance. Recently, colleagues and I generalized Taylor's law to samples from probability distributions with infinite mean or infinite variance and higher moments. For such heavy-tailed distributions, we extended Taylor's law to higher moments than the mean and variance and to upper and lower semivariances (measures of upside and downside portfolio risk). In unpublished work, we suggest that U.S. COVID-19 cases and deaths illustrate Taylor's law arising from a distribution with finite mean and infinite variance. This model has practical implications.

Although the bulk of this transition is in the same universality class as the paradigmatic deconfined Neel to valence-bond-solid transition, the boundary physics has a richer structure due to proximity to a quantum spin Hall state. We use the parton trick to write down an effective field theory for the QSH-SC transition in the presence of a boundary and calculate various edge properties in a large-N limit. We show that the boundary Luttinger liquid in the QSH state survives at the phase transition, but only as fractional degrees of freedom that carry charge but not spin. The physical fermion remains gapless on the edge at the critical point, with a universal jump in the fermion scaling dimension as the system approaches the transition from the QSH side. The critical point could be viewed as a gapless analogue of the QSH state but with the full SU(2) spin rotation symmetry, which cannot be realized if the bulk is gapped.

The process starts with a given $n$-vertex graph $G_0$.

From many points of view, it is conjectured that this physics may be pointing at basic properties of quantum spacetimes and gravity.\nFor information on how to join, please see:  https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/seminars-and-colloquium/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-colloquium-edge-modes-and-gravity/"},

Their exact solvability, it turns out, is rooted in the existence of commuting generators in their parent lattice gauge theory (LGT). We can understand the toric codes as Higgsed descendants of the rank-1 U(1) LGT in two and three dimensions, and the X-cube model as that of rank-2 U(1) LGT in three dimensions. Furthermore, the transformation properties of the gauge fields in the respective LGT is responsible for, and nearly determines the structure of the effective field theory (EFT) of the accompanying matter fields. We show how to construct the EFT of e and m particles in the toric codes and of fractons and lineons in the X-cube model by following such an idea. Recently we proposed some stabilizer Hamiltonians termed rank-2 toric code (R2TC) and F3 model (3D). We will explain what they are, and construct their EFTs using the gauge principle as guidance. The resulting field theory of the matter fields are usually highly interacting and exhibit unusual conservation laws. Especially for the R2TC, we demonstrate the existence of what we call the “dipolar braiding statistics” and outline the accompanying field theory which differs from the usual BF field theory of anyon braiding.\nFor information on how to join, please see:  https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/seminars-and-colloquium/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-lattice-gauge-theory-view-of-toric-codes-x-cube-and-more/"},

Although much is known about the molecular pathways that control cell fate decisions, it remains unclear how macroscopic features of branched organs, including their size, network topology and spatial pattern are encoded. Based on large-scale reconstructions of the mouse mammary gland and kidney, we begin by showing that statistical features of the developing branched epithelium can be explained quantitatively by a local self-organizing principle based on a branching and annihilating random walk (BARW). In this model, renewing tip-localized progenitors drive a serial process of ductal elongation and stochastic tip bifurcation that terminates when active tips encounter maturing ducts. Then, based on reconstructions of the developing mouse salivary gland, we propose a generalisation of BARW model in which tips arrested through steric interaction with proximate ducts reactivate their branching programme as constraints become alleviated through the expansion of the underlying mesenchyme. This inflationary branching-arresting random walk model offers a more general paradigm for branching morphogenesis when the ductal epithelium grows cooperatively with the tissue into which it expands.\nFor information on how to join, please see:  https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/seminars-and-colloquium/", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-theories-of-branching-morphogenesis/"},

If a given ALH manifold is asymptotic to a static reference manifold, the Wang-Chruściel-Herzlich mass integrals are well-defined, which is a geometric invariant that essentially measure the difference from the reference manifold. In this talk, I will present the result that an ALH manifold which minimize the mass integrals admits a static potential. To show this, we proved the scalar curvature map is locally surjective when it is defined on (1) the space of ALH metrics that coincide exponentially toward the boundary or (2) the space of ALH metrics with arbitrarily prescribed nearby Bartnik boundary data. And then, we establish the rigidity of the known positive mass theorems by studying the static uniqueness. This talk is based on joint work with L.-H. Huang.\nAbstract:\n In this talk, we will discuss some recent estimates on the Bartnik mass for data with non-negative Gauss curvature and positive mean curvature. In particular, if the metric is round the estimate reduces to an estimate found by Miao and if the total mean curvature approaches 0, the estimate tends to 1/2 the area radius, which is the bound found by Mantoulidis and Schoen in the blackhole horizon case. We will then discuss some geometric implications. This is joint work with Pengzi Miao.\nAbstract:\n We generalize the density theorems for the Einstein constraint equations of Corvino-Schoen and Eichmair-Huang-Lee-Schoen to allow for marginally outer trapped boundaries (which correspond physically to apparent horizons). As an application, we resolve the spacetime positive mass theorem in the presence of MOTS boundary in the non-spin case. This also has a surprising application to the Riemannian setting, including a non-filling result for manifolds with negative mass. This is joint work with Martin Lesourd and Dan Lee.\nAbstract: \nGromov’s dihedral extremality and rigidity conjectures concern comparisons of scalar curvature, mean curvature and dihedral angle for compact manifolds with corners. They have very interesting consequences in geometry and mathematical physics. The conjectures themselves can in some sense be viewed as “localizations” of the positive mass theorem. I will explain some recent work on positive solutions to these conjectures and some related applications (such as a positive solution to the Stoker conjecture). The talks are based on my joint works with Jinmin Wang and Guoliang Yu.\nAbstract:\n For any closed oriented manifold with fundamental group G, or more generally any group homology class for a group G, I will discuss an infinite codimension Plateau problem in a Hilbert classifying space for G. For instance, for a closed oriented 3-manifold M, the intrinsic geometry of any Plateau solution is given by the hyperbolic part of M.\nTuesday, May 3, 2022\nAbstract:\n There have been a classical theory for complete minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds, including the stable Bernstein conjecture in R^3 and rigidity results in 3-manifolds with positive Ricci curvature. In this talk, I will discuss how one may extend these results in four dimensions. This leads to new comparison theorems for positively curved 4-manifolds.\nAbstract: \nWhat can you say about the structure or a-priori regularity of a Riemannian manifold if you know certain bounds on its curvature? To understand this question, it is often important to understand in what sense a sequence of Riemannian manifolds (possessing a given curvature constraint) will converge, and what the limiting objects look like. In this mini-course, we introduce the notions of $d_p$ convergence of Riemannian manifolds and of rectifiable Riemannian spaces, the objects that arise as $d_p$ limits. This type of convergence can be useful in contexts when the distance functions of the Riemannian manifolds are not uniformly controlled. This course is based on joint work with Man Chun Lee and Aaron Naber.\nAbstract:\n The study of static vacuum Riemannian metrics arises naturally in differential geometry and general relativity. It plays an important role in scalar curvature deformation, as well as in constructing Einstein spacetimes. Existence of static vacuum Riemannian metrics with prescribed Bartnik data — the induced metric and mean curvature of the boundary — is one of the most fundamental problems in Riemannian geometry related to general relativity. It is also a very interesting problem on the global solvability of a natural geometric boundary value problem. In this talk I will first discuss some basic properties of the nonlinear and linearized static vacuum equations and the geometric boundary conditions. Then I will present some recent progress towards the existence problem of static vacuum metrics based on joint works with Lan-Hsuan Huang.\nAbstract: \nGromov’s dihedral extremality and rigidity conjectures concern comparisons of scalar curvature, mean curvature and dihedral angle for compact manifolds with corners.

In this talk, we will see the role of spacetime positive mass theorem in answering the corresponding questions for initial data sets.\nWednesday, May 4, 2022\nAbstract:\n With A. Deruelle, we define a Perelman-like functional for ALE metrics which lets us study the (in)stability of Ricci-flat ALE metrics. With J. Baldauf, we extend some classical objects and formulas from the study of scalar curvature, spin geometry and general relativity to manifolds with densities. We surprisingly find that the extension of ADM mass is the opposite of the above functional introduced with A. Deruelle. Through a weighted Witten’s formula, this functional also equals a weighted spinorial Dirichlet energy on spin manifolds. Ricci flow is the gradient flow of all of these quantities.\nAbstract: \nWhat can you say about the structure or a-priori regularity of a Riemannian manifold if you know certain bounds on its curvature?

This spectral generalization of positive (nonnegative) scalar curvature arises naturally, for different values of k, in the study of scalar curvature in dimension n + 1 via minimal surfaces, the Yamabe problem in dimension n, and Perelman’s surgery for Ricci flow in dimension n = 3. We study these spaces in unison and generalize, as appropriate, scalar curvature results that we eventually apply to k = 1/2, where the space above models apparent horizons in time-symmetric initial data sets to the Einstein equations and whose flexibility properties are intimately tied with the instability of the Riemannian Penrose Inequality. This is joint work with Chao Li.\nAbstract: \nGromov’s dihedral extremality and rigidity conjectures concern comparisons of scalar curvature, mean curvature and dihedral angle for compact manifolds with corners.

The talks are based on my joint works with Jinmin Wang and Guoliang Yu.\nAbstract:\n It is well known that minimal hypersurfaces produced by the Almgren-Pitts min-max theory are counted with integer multiplicities. For bumpy metrics (which form a generic set), the multiplicities are one thanks to the resolution of the Marques-Neves Multiplicity One Conjecture. In this talk, we will exhibit a set of non-bumpy metrics on the standard (n+1)-sphere, in which the min-max varifold associated with the second volume spectrum is a multiplicity two n-sphere. Such non-bumpy metrics form the first set of examples where the min-max theory must produce higher multiplicity minimal hypersurfaces. The talk is based on a joint work with Zhichao Wang (UBC).\nMay 5, 2022\nAbstract: \nI will talk about joint work with Lucas Ambrozio and Fernando Marques where we study the space of metrics where all the equators are minimal.\nAbstract: \nWhat can you say about the structure or a-priori regularity of a Riemannian manifold if you know certain bounds on its curvature?

This course is based on joint work with Man Chun Lee and Aaron Naber.\nAbstract:\n We describe some recent work that has been done to generalize the notion of lower scalar curvature bounds to C^0 metrics, including a localized Ricci flow approach. In particular, we show the following: that there is a Ricci flow definition which is stable under greater-than-second-order perturbation of the metric, that there exists a reasonable notion of a Ricci flow starting from C^0 initial data which is smooth for positive times, and that the weak lower scalar curvature bounds are preserved under evolution by the Ricci flow from C^0 initial data.\nAbstract: \nWidth or waist inequalities measure the size of a manifold with respect to measures of families of submanifolds.

The seemingly unlimited breadth and depth of these sources provide the means to study complex systems in a more comprehensive way.

In this talk I will argue that standard tools of holography can be used to describe fully non-perturbative microscopic models of cosmology in which a period of accelerated expansion may result from the positive potential energy of time-dependent scalar fields evolving towards a region with negative potential. In these models, the fundamental cosmological constant is negative, and the universe eventually recollapses in a time-reversal symmetric way. The microscopic description naturally selects a special state for the cosmology. In this framework, physics in the cosmological spacetime is dual to the vacuum physics in a static planar asymptotically AdS Lorentzian wormhole spacetime, in the sense that the background spacetimes and observables are related by analytic continuation. The dual spacetime is weakly curved everywhere, so any cosmological observables can be computed in the dual picture via effective field theory without detailed knowledge of the UV completion or the physics near the big bang.

As a consequence, we also obtain cosection localization results for (-2)-shifted symplectic derived schemes. This provides a cosection localization formalism for the Borisov-Joyce DT invariant.

However, the huge size of raw data hinders its popularity in practice, so can we almost perfectly restore the raw data from a compressed RGB image and thus avoid storing any raw data? This question leads us to design an invertible image signal processing pipeline. Then we further explore invertibility in other image processing and restoration tasks, including image compression, reversible image conversion (e.g., image-to-video conversion), and embedding novel views in a single JPEG image. We demonstrate that customized invertible neural networks are highly effective in these inherently non-invertible tasks.\nZoom ID: 950 2372 5230 (Password: cmsa)", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-cmsa-interdisciplinary-science-seminar-a-universal-triangulation-for-flat-tori-2/"},

The eigenvalues of the resulting matrices lie inside the unit disk and are a model for scattering resonances of more general chaotic quantum systems.\nWe establish a spectral gap (that is, the spectral radius of the matrix is separated from 1 as $N\\to\\infty$) for all the systems considered. The proof relies on the notion of fractal uncertainty principle and uses the fine structure of the trapped sets, which in our case are given by Cantor sets, together with simple tools from harmonic analysis, algebra, combinatorics, and number theory. We also obtain a fractal Weyl upper bound for the number of eigenvalues in annuli.

We show that integrable chiral Luttinger liquid is not always a good low energy description of the edge states, and marginal interactions can significantly affect their spectrum and integrability. We first study N identical chiral Majorana fermion modes with random 4-fermion interactions, where we show that the system undergoes a transition from integrable to quantum chaotic as N increases. The large N limit defines a chiral SYK model where the Lyapunov exponent in the out-of-time-ordered correlation can be solved analytically.

I will discuss how quantum anomalies in these symmetries produce the local Bardeen-Zumino terms that ensure that the corresponding consistent Noether currents in the diffeomorphism and supersymmetry Ward identities are replaced by their covariant form. An important difference between diffeomorphisms and supersymmetry is that, while the effective action remains invariant under diffeomorphisms in the absence of a gravitational anomaly, the local terms in the supersymmetry Ward identity generated by quantum anomalies in other symmetries generally result in the non-invariance of the effective action under supersymmetry. In certain cases, however, supersymmetry invariance may be restored by suitably enlarging the multiplet that contains the anomalous Noether current. The structure of all local terms in the Ward identities due to quantum anomalies can be determined by solving the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions, which can be reformulated as a BRST cohomology problem. I will present a generalization of the standard BRST algebra for gauge theories and the associated anomaly descent procedure that is necessary for accommodating diffeomorphisms and supersymmetry transformations. I will also discuss how, in some cases, the solution of the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions in the presence of supersymmetry can be efficiently determined from a supersymmetric Chern-Simons action in one dimension higher through anomaly inflow.

Since its proof-of-concept research in 2001, PROTAC has been vigorously developed by both research community and pharma industry, to act against therapeutically significant proteins, such as BRD4, BTK, and STAT3. However, despite the enthusiasm, designing PROTACs is challenging. Till now, no case of de novo rational design of PROTACs has been reported and the successful PROTACs usually came from the functional screen from a limitedly scaled library.  As formation of a ternary complex between the protein target, the PROTAC, and the recruited E3 ligase is considered paramount for successful degradation, several computational algorithms (PRosettaC as the example), have been developed to model this ternary complex, which have got partial agreement with the experimental data and in principle inform future rational PROTAC design.

These are described by the Einstein equations, which can be written as a system of nonlinear, hyperbolic partial differential equations. Recent years have seen fruitful interactions between physical questions and geometric analysis, sparking new breakthroughs, in particular related to gravitational radiation. Gravitational waves transport information from faraway regions of the Universe. They were observed for the first time by Advanced LIGO in 2015. So far, most studies in GR have been devoted to sources like binary black hole mergers or generally to sources that are stationary outside of a compact set. However, when extended neutrino halos are present, the situation changes.  Mathematically, we describe these systems by asymptotically-flat manifolds solving the Einstein equations. In this talk, I will present new results on gravitational radiation for sources that are not stationary outside of a compact set, but whose gravitational fields fall off more slowly towards infinity. A panorama of new gravitational effects opens up when delving deeper into these more general spacetimes. In particular, whereas the former sources produce memory effects (permanent change of the spacetime) that are finite and of purely electric parity, the latter in addition generate memory of magnetic type, and both types grow. These new effects emerge naturally from the Einstein equations.\nRegistration is required to receive the Zoom information.\nPlease go \nhere\n to register.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/special-colloquium-2/"},

The key observation is that while this object is only an almost dg Lie algebra (or pre-dg Lie algebra), it is sufficient to prove unobstructedness of the associated Maurer-Cartan equation (a kind of Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem) under suitable assumptions, so the former can be regarded as a singular version of the Kodaira-Spencer DGLA. Our framework applies to degenerate CY varieties previously studied by Kawamata-Namikawa and Gross-Siebert, as well as a more general class of varieties called toroidal crossing spaces (by the recent work of Felten-Filip-Ruddat).

Plenty of well-performing approximation algorithms have been designed for the maximization of (monotone or non-monotone) submodular functions over a variety of constraints. In this talk, we consider the submodular multiple knapsack problem (SMKP), which is the submodular version of the well-studied multiple knapsack problem (MKP). Roughly speaking, the problem asks to maximize a monotone submodular function over multiple bins (knapsacks). Recently, Fairstein et al. (ESA20) presented a tight (1−1/e−ϵ)-approximation randomized algorithm for SMKP. Their algorithm is based on the continuous greedy technique which inherently involves randomness. However, the deterministic algorithm of this problem has not been understood very well previously. In this paper, we present a tight (1−1/e−ϵ) deterministic algorithm for SMKP. Our algorithm is based on reducing SMKP to an exponential-size submodular maximizaion problem over a special partition matroid which enjoys a tight deterministic algorithm. We develop several techniques to mimic the algorithm, leading to a tight deterministic approximation for SMKP.\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/98248914765?pwd=Q01tRTVWTVBGT0lXek40VzdxdVVPQT09\n(Password: 419419)", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-condensed-matter-math-seminar-topological-qauntum-field-theory-in-31d-and-a-potential-origin-of-dark-matter-2-2-3-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

In SSL, a learning machine captures the dependencies between input variables, some of which may be observed, denoted X, and others not always observed, denoted Y. SSL pre-training has revolutionized natural language processing and is making very fast progress in speech and image recognition. SSL may enable machines to learn predictive models of the world through observation, and to learn representations of the perceptual world, thereby reducing the number of labeled samples or rewarded trials to learn a downstream task. In the Energy-Based Model framework (EBM), both X and Y are inputs, and the model outputs a scalar energy that measures the degree of incompatibility between X and Y. EBMs are implicit functions that can represent complex and multimodal dependencies between X and Y. EBM architectures belong to two main families: joint embedding architectures and latent-variable generative architectures. There are two main families of methods to train EBMs: contrastive methods, and volume regularization methods. Much of the underlying mathematics of EBM is borrowed from statistical physics, including concepts of partition function, free energy, and variational approximations thereof.\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/779283357?pwd=MitXVm1pYUlJVzZqT3lwV2pCT1ZUQT09", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/mikhlin-type-fourier-multipliers-on-free-groups-and-free-products-of-von-neumann-algebras-2-2-3-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2/"},

We recently reported that a decrease or absence of MT bundling, despite high levels of intratumoral taxanes, is a basis and a potential pharmacodynamic biomarker of taxane resistance. To determine the molecular basis for this impaired MT bundling, we treated docetaxel sensitive PCa models \nin vivo \nfor multiple cycles until resistance, and found upregulation of FOXJ1 (a master transcription factor regulating tubulin associated proteins), as well as one of its downstream effector protein, TPPP3, in the resistant tumors. Moreover, mining of patient databases showed that amplification of the \nFOXJ1 \ngene is also associated with taxane exposure. Together these data implicate the FOXJ1-TPPP3 regulatory network in taxane resistance. In parallel with these \nin vivo \nstudies, we have carried \nin vitro \ndrug screens for agents that enhance responses to docetaxel in 3D/organoid culture. A prominent agent that emerged is a histone methyltransferase inhibitor. Our overall goals are to identify clinically meaningful mechanisms of taxane resistance, to develop therapeutic combinations that enhance efficacy and/or target these resistance mechanisms, and to identify biomarkers indicative of specific mechanisms. Our hypotheses, which are based on our published and preliminary data, are that one major mechanism for taxane resistance is upregulation of the FOXJ1-TPPP3 pathway, and that combination therapies can be developed that enhance taxane efficacy and delay or prevent the emergence of resistance. The specific aims are 1) Determine the effect of FOXJ1-TPPP3 regulatory network on microtubule dynamics, stability and target-engagement by taxanes \nin vitro \nand \nin vivo \nand 2) Identify effective combination therapies to enhance docetaxel responses and overcome taxane resistance.\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/98248914765?pwd=Q01tRTVWTVBGT0lXek40VzdxdVVPQT09\n(Password: 419419)", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-condensed-matter-math-seminar-topological-qauntum-field-theory-in-31d-and-a-potential-origin-of-dark-matter-2-2-3-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

In most non-motile cells, local perturbations to membrane tension remain highly localized, leading to subcellular Ca2+ influx and vesicle fusion events. Membrane-cortex attachments are responsible for impeding the propagation of membrane tension. Exception to this rule can be found in the axon of neurons, where a rapid propagation of membrane tension coordinates the growth and branching of the axon.\nIn the second part, I’ll discuss the development of quantitative techniques to measure the surface tension and viscosity of liquid protein condensates.

This generalizes the Kramers-Wannier duality line in 1+1 dimensions to higher spacetime dimensions. We focus on the case of a one-form symmetry in 3+1 dimensions, and determine the fusion rule. From modular invariance and a direct analysis of one-form symmetry protected topological phases, we show that the existence of certain kinds of duality defects is intrinsically incompatible with a trivially gapped phase. By further assuming time-reversal symmetry, we find that the presence of certain duality defects implies that the low-energy phase has to be gapless unless the one-form symmetry is spontaneously broken. We give an explicit realization of this duality defect in the free Maxwell theory where the duality defect is realized by a Chern-Simons coupling between the gauge fields from the two sides.\n-----\n\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA seminar videos (more to be uploaded):\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBmPO-OK1sa8T1oX_9aVhAg/playlists\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM06KiUOw1vRrmvD8U274Ww\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126\n\nPassword: cmsa", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-seminar-line-defects-in-cfts-renormalization-group-flows-and-semiclassical-limits-2-2-2-3/"},

The broader implications of these considerations for Quantum Materials and Quantum Field Theory will be discussed.\n* Work done with Yashar Komijani, Anna Toth, Premi Chandra and Alexei Tsvelik.\n[1] Order Fractionalization, Yashar Komijani, Anna Toth, Premala Chandra, Piers Coleman, (2018).\n[2] Order Fractionalization in a Kitaev Kondo model, Alexei Tsvelik and Piers Coleman, (2021).\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-strongly-correlated-quantum-materials-and-high-temperature-superconductors-seminar-order-fractionalization/"},

Quantum information theory, however, casts doubt on this folklore and suggests a different tale; the outgoing Hawking mode will be decoupled from the early radiation once an infalling observer, with finite positive energy, jumps into a black hole. In this talk, I will provide counterarguments against current mainstream proposals and present an alternative resolution of the firewall puzzle which is consistent with predictions from quantum information theory. My proposal builds on the fact that interior operators can be constructed in a state-independent manner once an infalling observer is explicitly included as a part of the quantum system.

I will discuss two different directions that lead to generalizations of this conjecture. The first direction concerns different quantum invariants of knots, arising from the colored SU(n) (with the colored Jones polynomial corresponding to the case n=2). I will first display subtle relations between congruence relations, cyclotomic expansions and the original Volume Conjecture for the colored Jones polynomials of knots. I will then generalize this point of view to the colored SU(n) invariant of knots. Certain congruence relations for the colored SU(n) invariants, discovered in joint work with K. Liu, P. Peng and S. Zhu, lead us to formulate cyclotomic expansions and a Volume Conjecture for these colored SU(n) invariants. If time permits, I will briefly discuss similar ideas for the Superpolynomials that arise in HOMFLY-PT homology.\nAnother direction for generalization involves the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev and the (modified) Turaev-Viro quantum invariants of 3-manifolds. In a joint work with T. Yang, I formulated a Volume Conjecture for the asymptotics of these 3-manifolds invariants evaluated at certain roots of unity, and numerically checked it for many examples. Interestingly, this conjecture uses roots of unity that are different from the one usually considered in literature. These 3-manifolds invariants are only polynomially large at the usual root of unity as the level of the representation approaches infinity, which is predicted by Witten’s Asymptotic Expansion Conjecture. True understanding of this new phenomenon requires new physical and geometric interpretations that go beyond the usual quantum Chern-Simons theory. Currently these new Volume Conjectures have been proved for many examples by various groups. However, like the original Volume Conjecture, a complete proof for general cases is still an open problem in this area. In a recent joint work with J. Murakami, I proved the asymptotic behavior of the quantum 6j-symbol evaluated at the unusual root of unity, which could explain the Volume Conjectures for the asymptotics of the Turaev-Viro invariants in general.\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/98248914765?pwd=Q01tRTVWTVBGT0lXek40VzdxdVVPQT09\n(Password: 419419)", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-condensed-matter-math-seminar-topological-qauntum-field-theory-in-31d-and-a-potential-origin-of-dark-matter-2-2-3-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

This provides a general way to compute anomalies in (2+1)D fermionic symmetry-enriched topological states of matter. Our construction uses the fermionic topological order (characterized by a super-modular tensor category) and symmetry fractionalization data to define a (3+1)D path integral for a bosonic theory that hosts a non-trivial emergent fermionic particle, and then condenses the fermion by summing over closed 3-form Z_2 background gauge fields. This procedure involves a number of non-trivial higher-form anomalies associated with Fermi statistics and fractional quantum numbers that need to be appropriately canceled off with a Grassmann integral that depends on a generalized spin structure. We show how our construction reproduces the Z_16 anomaly indicator for time-reversal symmetric topological superconductors with T^2=(−1)^F. Mathematically, with standard technical assumptions, this implies that our construction gives a combinatorial state sum on a triangulated 4-manifold that can distinguish all Z_16 Pin+ smooth bordism classes. As such, it contains the topological information encoded in the eta invariant of the pin+ Dirac operator, thus giving an example of a state sum TQFT that can distinguish exotic smooth structure.\nRef: arXiv:2104.14567\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-condensed-matter-math-seminar-topological-qauntum-field-theory-in-31d-and-a-potential-origin-of-dark-matter-2-2-3-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-3-2-2-2-2-2-3/"},

The extraordinary fixed point corresponds to the bulk transition occurring in the presence of an ordered boundary, while the special fixed point corresponds to a boundary phase transition between the ordinary and the extra-ordinary classes. While the ordinary fixed point survives in d = 3, it is less clear what happens to the extra-ordinary and special fixed points when d = 3 and N is greater or equal to 2. I'll show that formally treating N as a continuous parameter, there exists a critical value Nc > 2 separating two distinct regimes. For N < Nc the extra-ordinary fixed point survives in d = 3, albeit in a modified form: the long-range boundary order is lost, instead, the order parameter correlation function decays as a power of log r. For N > Nc there is no fixed point with order parameter correlations decaying slower than power law.

An advantage of this approach is that a single formulation can capture both the insulating and superconducting states, and with a few simplifying assumptions, can be treated analytically. I begin by reviewing the electronic structure of magic angle graphene’s flat bands, in a limit that exposes their peculiar band topology and geometry. I will show how similarities between the flat bands and the lowest Landau level can provide valuable insights into the effect of interactions and form the basis for an analytic treatment of the problem. At integer fillings, this approach points to flavor ordered insulators, which can be captured by a sigma-model in its ordered phase. Remarkably, topological textures of the sigma model carry electric charge which enables the same theory to describe the doped phases away from integer filling. I will show how this approach can lead to superconductivity on disordering the sigma model, and estimate the Tc for the superconductor. I will highlight the important role played by an effective super-exchange coupling both in pairing and in setting the effective mass of Cooper pairs. At the end, I will show how this theory provides criteria to predict which multilayer graphene stacks are expected to superconduct including the recently discovered alternating twist trilayer platform.\n\n-----\n\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA seminar videos (more to be uploaded):\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBmPO-OK1sa8T1oX_9aVhAg/playlists\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM06KiUOw1vRrmvD8U274Ww\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-seminar-on-the-firewall-puzzle-2-2-2-3-2-2-2/"},

We then introduce certain vector bundles (K-classes) on permutohedral varieties, which we call \"tautological bundles (classes)\" of matroids, as a new framework that unifies, recovers, and extends these recent developments.  Our framework leads to new questions that further probe the boundary between combinatorics and geometry.  Joint work with Andrew Berget, Hunter Spink, and Dennis Tseng.\nWebpage:\n \nhttps://sites.google.com/view/harvardmitag", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/measuring-the-irrationality-of-complete-intersections-2/"},

Similarly, open Gromov-Witten invariants are supposed to count disks with boundary on a Lagrangian, but in most cases such counts are not independent of some choices as we would wish. Motivated by Fukaya'11, J. Solomon and S. Tukachinsky constructed open Gromov-Witten invariants in their 2016 papers from an algebraic perspective of $A_{\\infty}$-algebras of differential forms, utilizing the idea of bounding chains in Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono’06. On the other hand, Welschinger defined open invariants on sixfolds in 2012 that count multi-disks weighted by the linking numbers between their boundaries. We present a geometric translation of Solomon-Tukachinsky’s construction. From this geometric perspective, their invariants readily reduce to Welschinger's.\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/98781914555?pwd=bmVzZGdlRThyUDREMExab20ybmg1Zz09", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-algebraic-geometry-in-string-theory-seminar-what-do-bounding-chains-look-like-and-why-are-they-related-to-linking-numbers/"},

The problem has a storied history and was studied by such eminent mathematicians as Gauss and Polya. The problem has also found applications in fields such as algorithm design and circuit development.\nDespite much study, until recently very little was known regarding the asymptotics of Q(n). We apply modern methods from probabilistic combinatorics to reduce understanding Q(n) to the study of a particular infinite-dimensional convex optimization problem. The chief implication is that (in an appropriate sense) for a~1.94, Q(n) is approximately (ne^(-a))^n. Furthermore, our methods allow us to study the typical \"shape\" of n-queens configurations.\nZoom ID: 950 2372 5230 (Password: cmsa)", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-interdisciplinary-science-seminar-the-number-of-n-queens-configurations/"},

Metabolism provides a continuous flux of energy that dictates the form and function of many subcellular structures. These subcellular structures are active materials, composed of molecules which use chemical energy to perform mechanical work and locally violate detailed balance. One of the most dramatic examples of such a self-organizing structure is the spindle, the cytoskeletal based assembly which segregates chromosomes during cell division. Despite its central role, very little is known about the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of active subcellular matter, such as the spindle. In this talk, I will describe ongoing work from my lab aimed at understanding the flows of energy which drive the nonequilibrium behaviors of the cytoskeleton in vitro and in vivo.\nZoom link: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/96657833341\n*rescheduled from 9/16/21", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-seminar-the-many-phases-of-a-cell-2-2/"},

We show that in certain well-known c-principle contexts only the mildest cobordisms, semi-s-cobordisms, are required. In physical applications, the extra topology (a perfect fundamental group) these cobordisms introduce could easily be hidden in the UV.

The challenge is how to simultaneously retain key information in microscopic models as well as efficiency and robustness of macroscopic models. In this talk, I will illustrate how this challenge can be overcome by elucidating the probabilistic connections between models of different levels of detail. These connections explain how stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) arise naturally from particle models.\nI will also present some novel scaling limits including SPDE on graphs and coupled SPDE. These SPDE not only interpolate between particle models and PDE, but also quantify the source and the order of magnitude of stochasticity. Scaling limit theorems and duality formulas are obtained for these SPDE, which connect phenomena across scales and offer insights about the genealogies and the time-asymptotic properties of the underlying population dynamics.\nZoom link: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/96657833341 \nPassword: cmsa", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-active-matter-seminar-stochastic-pde-as-scaling-limits-of-interacting-particle-systems/"},

Price of anarchy is a technical game theoretic definition introduced to quantify the inefficiency arising in these scenarios-- it compares the welfare that can be achieved through perfect coordination against that achieved by self-interested agents at a Nash equilibrium. We derive a differentiable upper bound on a price of anarchy that agents can cheaply estimate during learning. Equipped with this estimator agents can adjust their incentives in a way that improves the efficiency incurred at a Nash equilibrium. Agents adjust their incentives by learning to mix their reward (equiv. negative loss) with that of other agents by following the gradient of our derived upper bound. We refer to this approach as D3C. In the case where agent incentives are differentiable D3C resembles the celebrated Win-Stay Lose-Shift strategy from behavioral game theory thereby establishing a connection between the global goal of maximum welfare and an established agent-centric learning rule. In the non-differentiable setting as is common in multiagent reinforcement learning we show the upper bound can be reduced via evolutionary strategies until a compromise is reached in a distributed fashion. We demonstrate that D3C improves outcomes for each agent and the group as a whole on several social dilemmas including a traffic network exhibiting Braess’s paradox a prisoner’s dilemma and several reinforcement learning domains.\nZoom ID: 950 2372 5230 (Password: cmsa)", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-cmsa-interdisciplinary-science-seminar-a-universal-triangulation-for-flat-tori-2-2-2/"},

Let Q(n) denote the number of n-queens configurations on the classical board and T(n) the number of toroidal n-queens configurations. The toroidal problem was first studied in 1918 by Pólya who showed that T(n)>0 if and only if n is not divisible by 2 or 3. Much more recently Luria showed that T(n) is at most ((1+o(1))ne^{-3})^n and conjectured equality when n is not divisible by 2 or 3. We prove this conjecture, prior to which no non-trivial lower bounds were known to hold for all (sufficiently large) n not divisible by 2 or 3. We also show that Q(n) is at least ((1+o(1))ne^{-3})^n for all natural numbers n which was independently proved by Luria and Simkin and, combined with our toroidal result, completely settles a conjecture of Rivin, Vardi and Zimmerman regarding both Q(n) and T(n).\nIn this talk we'll discuss our methods used to prove these results.

We analyze this process from the perspective of decomposition, a property of (1+1)-dimensional theories with ``one-form symmetries'' first described in 2006. Examples of such theories include orbifolds with trivially-acting subgroups, of which the extensions of [X/G] are examples. After a review of decomposition, we will see that decomposition implies that in (1+1) dimensions, the Wang-Wen-Witten procedure results in orbifolds that are equivalent to disjoint unions of orbifolds of X by explicitly nonanomalous subgroups of G.\n\n-----\n\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA seminar videos (more to be uploaded):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBmPO-OK1sa8T1oX_9aVhAg/playlists\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM06KiUOw1vRrmvD8U274Ww\n\n\n-----\n\nSubscribe to Harvard CMSA seminar videos (more to be uploaded):\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBmPO-OK1sa8T1oX_9aVhAg/playlists\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM06KiUOw1vRrmvD8U274Ww\nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126\n\nPassword: cmsa", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics-seminar-line-defects-in-cfts-renormalization-group-flows-and-semiclassical-limits-2-2-2-2/"},

Though these conditions are prevalent, treatment options remain relatively poor, relying primarily on various forms of immunosuppression which carry potentially severe side effects and often lose effectiveness overtime. Given this, new forms of therapy are needed. To this end, we have developed methods for the creation of small-interfering RNA (siRNA) for hypervariable regions of the T-cell receptor β-chain gene (TCRb) as a highly targeted, novel means of therapy for the treatment of autoimmune disorders.\nThis talk will review the general mechanism by which autoimmune diseases occur and discuss the pros and cons of conventional pharmaceutical therapies as they pertain to autoimmune disease treatment. I will then examine the rational and design methodology for the proposed siRNA therapy and how it contrasts with contemporary methods for the treatment of these conditions. Additionally, the talk will compare the efficacy of multiple design strategies for such molecules by comparison over several metrics and discuss how this will be guiding future research.\nZoom ID: 950 2372 5230 (Password: cmsa)", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-cmsa-interdisciplinary-science-seminar-a-universal-triangulation-for-flat-tori-2-2/"},

While there are various different notions of \"non-trivial solutions\", in this talk we say that a solution is non-trivial if all of its variables are distinct.\nA particularly famous and important instance of the question above is the problem of bounding the largest size of a subset of \\mathbb{F}_p^n which does not contain a three-term arithmetic progression. In 2016, Ellenberg and Gijswijt made a breakthrough on this problem and the approach in their proof was later generalized by Tao yielding what is now called the slice rank polynomial method. Unfortunately, for other instances of the question above, the slice rank polynomial method cannot handle the condition for the variables in a non-trivial solution to be distinct.\nIn this talk, we will first give a brief survey on the slice rank polynomial method and some of its applications, and we will then discuss two different results concerning the question above.

Contact Calabi-Yau 7-manifolds are, in the simplest cases, such circle bundles over Calabi-Yau 3-orbifolds. These 7-manifolds provide testing grounds for the study of geometric flows which seek to find torsion-free G2-structures (and thus Ricci flat metrics with exceptional holonomy). They also give useful backgrounds to examine the heterotic G2 system (also known as the G2-Hull-Strominger system), which is a coupled set of PDEs arising from physics that involves the G2-structure and gauge theory on the 7-manifold. I will report on recent progress on both of these directions in the study of contact Calabi-Yau 7-manifolds, which is joint work with H. Sá Earp and J.

In general, Steiner Systems are equivalent to decompositions of complete uniform hypergraphs into other complete uniform hypergraphs (of some specified sizes). The Existence Conjecture for Combinatorial Designs, which I proved in 2014, states that, bar finitely many exceptions, such decompositions exist whenever the necessary `divisibility conditions' hold. I also obtained a generalisation to the quasirandom setting, which implies an approximate formula for the number of designs; in particular, this resolved Wilson's Conjecture on the number of Steiner Triple Systems. A more general result that I proved in 2018 on decomposing lattice-valued vectors indexed by labelled complexes provides many further existence and counting results for a wide range of combinatorial objects, such as resolvable designs (the generalised form of Kirkman's Schoolgirl Problem), whist tournaments or generalised Sudoku squares.

The goal of this talk is to provide a blueprint — using tools from physics — for theoretically analyzing deep neural networks of practical relevance. This task will encompass both understanding the statistics of initialized deep networks and determining the training dynamics of such an ensemble when learning from data.\nIn terms of their \"microscopic\" definition, deep neural networks are a flexible set of functions built out of many basic computational blocks called neurons, with many neurons in parallel organized into sequential layers. Borrowing from the effective theory framework, we will develop a perturbative 1/n expansion around the limit of an infinite number of neurons per layer and systematically integrate out the parameters of the network. We will explain how the network simplifies at large width and how the propagation of signals from layer to layer can be understood in terms of a Wilsonian renormalization group flow. This will make manifest that deep networks have a tuning problem, analogous to criticality, that needs to be solved in order to make them useful. Ultimately we will find a \"macroscopic\" description for wide and deep networks in terms of weakly-interacting statistical models, with the strength of the interactions between the neurons growing with depth-to-width aspect ratio of the network. Time permitting, we will explain how the interactions induce representation learning.\nThis talk is based on a book, \"The Principles of Deep Learning Theory,\" co-authored with Sho Yaida and based on research also in collaboration with Boris Hanin.

Obtaining the counts of k-cliques in real-world \ngraphs with millions of nodes and edges is a challenging problem due to combinatorial explosion. Essentially, as k increases, the number of k-cliques goes up exponentially. Existing techniques are (typically) able to count k-cliques for only up to k=5.\nIn this talk, I will present two algorithms for obtaining k-clique counts that improve the state of the art, both in theory and in practice. The first method is a randomized algorithm that gives a (1+ε)-approximation for the number of k-cliques in a graph. Its running time is proportional to the size of an object called the Turán Shadow, which, for real-world graphs is found to be small. In practice, this algorithm works well for k<=10 and gives orders of magnitude improvement over existing methods. This paper won the Best Paper Award at WWW, 2017.\nThe second method, a somewhat surprising result, is a simple but powerful algorithm called Pivoter that gives the exact k-clique counts for all k and runs in O(n3^{n/3}) time in the worst case. It uses a classic technique called pivoting that drastically cuts down the search space for cliques and builds a structure called the Succinct Clique Tree from which global and local (per-vertex and per-edge) k-clique counts can be easily read off. In practice, the algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than even other parallel algorithms and makes clique counting feasible for a number of graphs for which clique counting was infeasible before.

Of course, many qualitative geometric models and quantitative estimates of the relevant distances precede his calculations. Moreover, since the estimated numbers of grains of sands are quite large (about $10^{64}$), Archimedes had to invent and describe a system of notation for large numbers going far outside the possibilities of any of the standard ancient systems.\nThe construction of the first bridge between number theory and topology  was accomplished only about fifty years ago: it is the theory of spectra in stable homotopy theory.\nIn particular, it connects $Z$, the initial object in the theory of commutative rings, with the sphere spectrum $S$.\nThis connection poses the challenge: discover a new information in number theory using the developed independently machinery of homotopy theory.\nIn this this talk based upon the authors’ (Yu. Manin and M. Marcolli) joint research project, I suggest to apply homotopy spectra to the problem of distribution of rational points upon algebraic manifolds.\nTalk chair: Michael Hopkins\nWritten articles will accompany each lecture in this series and be available as part of the publication\n “\nHistory and Literature of Mathematical Science\n.”\nFor more information, please visit \nthe event page\n.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/math-science-literature-lecture-series-6-3-3-3/"},

Modern deep learning algorithms typically have large generalization gaps, as they use more parameters than the size of their training set. Moreover the best known rigorous bounds on their generalization gap are often vacuous.\nIn this talk we will see a new upper bound on the generalization gap of classifiers that are obtained by first using self-supervision to learn a complex representation of the (label free) training data, and then fitting a simple (e.g., linear) classifier to the labels. Such classifiers have become increasingly popular in recent years, as they offer several practical advantages and have been shown to approach state-of-art results.\nWe show that (under the assumptions described below) the generalization gap of such classifiers tends to zero as long as the complexity of the simple classifier is asymptotically smaller than the number of training samples. We stress that our bound is independent of the complexity of the representation that can use an arbitrarily large number of parameters.\n\nOur bound assuming that the learning algorithm satisfies certain noise-robustness (adding small amount of label noise causes small degradation in performance) and rationality (getting the wrong label is not better than getting no label at all) conditions that widely (and sometimes provably) hold across many standard architectures.\n\nWe complement this result with an empirical study, demonstrating that our bound is non-vacuous for many popular representation-learning based classifiers on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, including SimCLR, AMDIM and BigBiGAN.\nThe talk will not assume any specific background in machine learning, and should be accessible to a general mathematical audience.

I will first talk about the enhanced U(4) or U(4)xU(4) symmetries of the projected TBG Hamiltonian with Coulomb interaction in various combinations of the flat band limit and two chiral limits. The symmetries in the first chiral and/or flat limits allow us to identify exact or approximate ground/low-energy (Chern) insulator states at all the integer fillings nu under a weak assumption, and to exactly compute charge +-1, +-2 and neutral excitations. In the realistic case away from the first chiral and flat band limits, we find perturbatively that the ground state at integer fillings nu has Chern number +-mod(nu,2), which is intervalley coherent if nu=0,+-1,+-2, and is valley polarized if nu=+-3. We further show that at nu=+-1 and +-2, a first order phase transition to a Chern number 4-|nu| state occurs in an out-of-plane magnetic field. Our calculation of excitations also rules out the Cooper pairing at integer fillings nu from Coulomb interaction in the flat band limit, suggesting other superconductivity mechanisms.

We aim to shed new light on this phase by investigating the non- superconducting ground state of several cuprate materials at low temperature across a wide doping range, suppressing superconductivity with a magnetic field. Hall effect measurements across the pseudogap critical doping p* reveal a sharp drop in carrier density n from n = 1 + p above p* to n = p below p*, signaling a major transformation of the Fermi surface. Angle-dependent magneto-resistance (ADMR) directly reveals a change in Fermi surface topology across p*. From specific heat measurements, we observe the classic thermodynamic signatures of quantum criticality: the electronic specific heat C el shows a sharp peak at p*, where it varies in temperature as C el ~ – T logT. At p* and just above, the electrical resistivity is linear in T at low T, with an inelastic scattering rate that obeys the Planckian limit. Finally, the pseudogap phase is found to have a large negative thermal Hall conductivity, which extends to zero doping.

This property alone guarantees the conservation of the overall dipole moment (i.e., the first multipole moment) in the low-energy sector. It is then natural to inquire about the fate of the transport properties of higher electric multipole moments, such as the quadrupole and octupole moments, and ask what properties of the insulating system can guarantee their conservation. In this talk I will present a suitable refinement of the notion of an insulator by investigating a class of systems that conserve both the total charge and the total dipole moment. In particular, I will consider microscopic models for systems that conserve dipole moments exactly and show that one can divide charge insulators into two new classes: (i) a dipole metal, which is a charge-insulating system that supports dipole-moment currents, or (ii) a dipole insulator which is a charge-insulating system that does not allow dipole currents and thus, conserves an overall quadrupole moment. In the second part of my talk I will discuss a more mathematical description of dipole-conserving systems where I show that a conservation of the overall dipole moment can be naturally attributed to a global 1-form electric U(1) symmetry, which is in direct analogy to how the electric charge conservation is guaranteed by the global U(1) phase-rotation symmetry for electrically charged particles.

We characterize the expressive power of GNNs from the perspective of graph isomorphism tests. We show an upper bound that GNNs are at most as powerful as a Weisfeiler-Lehman test. We then show conditions to achieve this upper bound, and present a maximally powerful GNN. Next, we analyze the generalization of GNNs. The optimization trajectories of over-parameterized GNNs trained by gradient descent correspond to those of kernel regression using a specific graph neural tangent kernel. Using this relation, we show GNNs provably learn a class of functions on graphs. More generally, we study how the architectural inductive biases influence generalization in a task. We introduce an algorithmic alignment measure, and show better alignment implies better generalization. Our framework suggests GNNs can sample-efficiently learn dynamic programming algorithms. Finally, we study how neural networks trained by gradient descent extrapolate, i.e., what they learn outside the support of the training distribution (e.g., on larger graphs or edge weights). We prove a linear extrapolation behavior of ReLU multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and identify conditions under which MLPs and GNNs extrapolate well.

I will also present evidence that boundary SUSY seems to be present in various higher dimensional examples also and might even be a general feature of all intrinsically fermionic SPT phases.\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-condensed-matter-math-seminar-topological-qauntum-field-theory-in-31d-and-a-potential-origin-of-dark-matter-2-2-3-2-3/"},

The talk will focus exclusively on the Hodge/period-theoretic aspects through two main examples. Given a variation of Hodge structure M on a Zariski open in P^1, the periods of the limiting mixed Hodge structures at the punctures are interesting invariants of M.  More generally, one can try to compute these asymptotic invariants for iterated extensions of M by \"Tate objects\", which may arise for example from normal functions associated to algebraic cycles. The main point of the talk will be that (with suitable assumptions on M) these invariants are encoded in an entire function called the motivic Gamma function, which is determined by the Picard-Fuchs operator L underlying M. In particular, when L is hypergeometric, this is easy to compute and we get a closed-form answer (and a limiting motive).  In the non-hypergeometric setting, it yields predictions for special values of normal functions; this part of the story is joint with V.

The problem is fascinating because it is simultaneously simple ‐ being a single band and 1⁄2 spin system, yet extremely rich ‐ boasting d‐wave superconductivity, pseudogap, spin and charge orders, and strange metal phenomenology. For this reason, cuprates emerge as the most important model system for correlated electrons – stimulating conversations on the physics of Hubbard model, quantum critical point, Planckian metal and beyond. Central to this debate is whether the Hubbard model, which is the natural starting point for the undoped magnetic insulator, contains the essential ingredients for key physics in cuprates. In this talk, I will discuss our photoemission evidence for a multifaceted answer to this question [1‐3]. First, we show results that naturally points to the importance of Coulomb and magnetic interactions, including d‐wave superconducting gap structure [4], exchange energy (J) control of bandwidth in single‐hole dynamics [5]. Second, we evidence effects beyond the Hubbard model, including band dispersion anomalies at known phonon frequencies [6, 7], polaronic spectral lineshape and the emergence of quasiparticle with doping [8]. Third, we show properties likely of hybrid electronic and phononic origin, including the pseudogap [9‐11], and the almost vertical phase boundary near the critical 19% doping [12]. Fourth, we show examples of small q phononic coupling that cooperates with d‐wave superconductivity [13‐15]. Finally, we discuss recent experimental advance in synthesizing and investigating doped one‐dimensional (1D) cuprates [16]. As theoretical calculations of the 1D Hubbard model are reliable, a robust comparison can be carried out. The experiment reveals a near‐neighbor attractive interaction that is an order of magnitude larger than the attraction generated by spin‐superexchange in the Hubbard model. Addition of such an attractive term, likely of phononic origin, into the Hubbard model with canonical parameters provides a quantitative explanation for all important experimental observable: spinon and holon dispersions, and holon‐ holon attraction. Given the structural similarity of the materials, It is likely that an extended two‐dimensional (2D) Hubbard model with such an attractive term, will connect the dots of the above four classes of experimental observables and provide a holistic understanding of cuprates, including the elusive d‐wave superconductivity in 2D Hubbard model.\n[1] A.

Recently the information bottleneck (IB), a signal processing tool, was proposed as an unbiased means for such order parameter extraction. While IB optimization was considered intractable for many years, new deep-learning-based techniques seem to solve it quite efficiently. In this talk, I'll introduce IB in the real-space renormalization context (a.k.a. RSMI), along with two recent theoretical results. One links IB optimization to the short-rangeness of coarse-grained Hamiltonians. The other provides a dictionary between the quantities extracted in IB, understood only qualitatively thus far, and relevant operators in the underlying field theory (or eigenvectors of the transfer matrix). Apart from relating field-theory and information, these results suggest that deep learning in conjunction with IB can provide useful and interpretable tools for studying complex systems.\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-condensed-matter-math-seminar-topological-qauntum-field-theory-in-31d-and-a-potential-origin-of-dark-matter-2-2-3-2-2-2-2/"},

These tendencies are intertwined in the sense that both originate from the same interaction mediated by gapless fluctuations of a critical order parameter. The two tendencies compete because fermionic incoherence destroys the Cooper logarithm, while the pairing eliminates scattering at low energies and restores fermionic coherence. I discuss this physics for a class of models with an effective dynamical interaction V (Ω) ~1/|Ω|^γ (the γ-model). This model describes, in particular, the pairing at a 2D Ising-nematic critical point in (γ=1/3), a 2D antiferromagnetic critical point (γ=1/2) and the pairing by an Einstein phonon with vanishing dressed Debye frequency (γ=2). I argue the pairing wins, unless the pairing component of the interaction is artificially reduced, but because of fermionic incoherence in the normal state, the system develops a pseudogap, preformed pairs behaviour in the temperature range between the onset of the pairing at Tp and the onset of phase coherence at the actual superconducting Tc. The ratio Tc/Tp decreases with γ and vanishes at γ =2. I present two complementary arguments of why this happens. One is the softening of longitudinal gap fluctuations, which become gapless at γ =2. Another is the emergence of a 1D array of dynamical vortices, whose number diverges at γ =2. I argue that once the number of vortices becomes infinite, quasiparticle energies effectively get quantized and do not get re-arranged in the presence of a small phase variation. I show that a new non-superconducting ground state emerges at γ >2.\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-strongly-correlated-quantum-materials-and-high-temperature-superconductors-series-universality-vs-materials-dependence-in-cuprates-arpes-studies-of-the-model-cuprate-hg1201-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

Experimental data suggest that the number of isomorphism classes of number fields of degree $n$ and discriminant bounded by $H$ is equivalent to $c(n)H$ when $n\\geqslant 2$ is fixed and $H$ tends to infinity. Such an estimate has been proved for $n=3$ by Davenport and Heilbronn and for $n=4$, $5$ by Bhargava. For an arbitrary $n$ Schmidt proved a bound of the form $c(n)H^{(n+2)/4}$ using Minkowski's theorem.

When studying the optimal transmission rates achievable with asymptotically vanishing error, it is usually assumed that these circuits can be implemented using noise-free gates. While this assumption is satisfied for classical machines in many scenarios, it is not expected to be satisfied in the near-term future for quantum machines, where decoherence leads to faults in the quantum gates. As a result, fundamental questions regarding the practical relevance of quantum channel coding remain open. By combining techniques from fault-tolerant quantum computation with techniques from quantum communication, we initiate the study of these questions.

I will begin by surveying fundamental results in discrepancy theory, including Spencer’s famous existence proofs and Bansal’s recent algorithmic realizations of them.\nRandomized Controlled Trials are used to test the effectiveness of interventions, like medical treatments.  Randomization is used to ensure that the test and control groups are probably similar.  When we know nothing about the experimental subjects, uniform random assignment is the best we can do.\nWhen we know information about the experimental subjects, called covariates, we can combine the strengths of randomization with the promises of discrepancy theory.  This should allow us to obtain more accurate estimates of the effectiveness of treatments, or to conduct trials with fewer experimental subjects.\nI will introduce the Gram-Schmidt Walk algorithm of Bansal, Dadush, Garg, and Lovett, which produces random solutions to discrepancy problems. I will then explain how Chris Harshaw, Fredrik Sävje, Peng Zhang and I use this algorithm to improve the design of randomized controlled trials. Our Gram-Schmidt Walk Designs have increased accuracy when the experimental outcomes are correlated with linear functions of the covariates, and are comparable to uniform random assignments in the worst case.\nWritten articles will accompany each lecture in this series and be available as part of the publication\n “\nHistory and Literature of Mathematical Science\n.”\nFor more information, please visit \nthe event page\n.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/math-science-literature-lecture-series-6-3-3-3-2-2-2/"},

A deep insight of William Thurston in the mid-1970s is that the vast majority of complements of knots in the 3-sphere, or more generally of 3-manifolds, have a unique metric structure as hyperbolic manifolds of constant curvature -1, so that 3-dimensional topology is in some sense not really a branch of topology at all, but of differential geometry. In a different direction, the work of Vaughan Jones and Ed Witten in the late 1980s gave rise to the field of Quantum Topology, in which new types of invariants of knot complements and 3-manifolds are introduced that have their origins in ideas coming from quantum field theory. These two themes then became linked by Kashaev’s famous Volume Conjecture, now some 25 years old, which says that the Kashaev invariant _N of a hyperbolic knot K (this is a quantum invariant defined for each positive integer N and whose values are algebraic numbers) grows exponentially as N tends to infinity with an exponent proportional to the hyperbolic volume of the knot complement. About 10 years ago, I was led by numerical experiments to the discovery that Kashaev’s invariant could be upgraded to an invariant having rational numbers as its argument (with the original invariant being the value at 1/N) and that the Volume Conjecture then became part of a bigger story saying that the new invariant has some sort of strange transformation property under the action x -> (ax+b)/(cx+d) of the modular group SL(2,Z) on the argument. This turned out to be only the beginning of a fascinating and multi-faceted story relating quantum invariants, q-series, modularity, and many other topics. In the talk, which is intended for a general mathematical audience, I would like to recount some parts of this story, which is joint work with Stavros Garoufalidis (and of course involving contributions from many other authors). The “new types of modularity” in the title refer to a specific byproduct of these investigations, namely that there is a generalization of the classical notion of holomorphic modular form – which plays an absolutely central role in modern number theory – to a new class of holomorphic functions in the upper half-plane that no longer satisfy a transformation law under the action of the modular group, but a weaker extendability property instead. This new class, called “holomorphic quantum modular forms”, turns out to contain many other functions of a more number-theoretical nature as well as the original examples coming from quantum invariants.\nTalk chair: Mark Kisin\nWritten articles will accompany each lecture in this series and be available as part of the publication\n “\nHistory and Literature of Mathematical Science\n.”\nFor more information, please visit \nthe event page\n.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/math-science-literature-lecture-series-6-3-3-3-2-2-2-2/"},

Additional unexpected features of this model are that it exhibits a superconductivity-induced transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies and a suppression of the superfluid density as seen in the cuprates.\n[1] PWP, L.

In this approach, the phase transition is due to the so-called avalanche instability of the MBL phase. I show that the critical behavior can be determined analytically within this RG. The RG flow near the critical fixed point is qualitatively similar to the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) flow, but there are important differences, and so this MBL transition is in a universality class that is distinct from KT.

However, there is little theoretical justification for their success. This paper considers the following questions: (1) Why should learning the distribution of natural language help with downstream classification tasks? (2) Why do features learned using language modeling help solve downstream tasks with linear classifiers? For (1), we hypothesize, and verify empirically, that classification tasks of interest can be reformulated as next word prediction tasks, thus making language modeling a meaningful pretraining task. For (2), we analyze properties of the cross-entropy objective to show that eps-optimal language models in cross-entropy (log-perplexity) learn features that are O(sqrt{eps}) good on such linear classification tasks, thus demonstrating mathematically that doing well on language modeling can be beneficial for downstream tasks. We perform experiments to verify assumptions and validate our theoretical results. Our theoretical insights motivate a simple alternative to the cross-entropy objective that performs well on some linear classification tasks.\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/99018808011?pwd=SjRlbWFwVms5YVcwWURVN3R3S2tCUT09", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-new-technologies-in-mathematics-self-induced-regularization-from-linear-regression-to-neural-networks-2-2-2-2-3-2-3-2-2/"},

Building off of notions developed in complexity theory and cryptography, we introduce and study Outcome Indistinguishability (OI). OI predictors yield a model of probabilities that cannot be efficiently refuted on the basis of the real-life observations produced by Nature.\nWe investigate a hierarchy of OI definitions, whose stringency increases with the degree to which distinguishers may access the predictor in question.  Our findings reveal that OI behaves qualitatively differently than previously studied notions of indistinguishability.  First, we provide constructions at all levels of the hierarchy.  Then, leveraging recently-developed machinery for proving average-case fine-grained hardness, we obtain lower bounds on the complexity of the more stringent forms of OI.  The hardness result provides scientific grounds for the political argument that, when inspecting algorithmic risk prediction instruments, auditors should be granted oracle access to the algorithm, not simply historical predictions.\nJoint work with Cynthia Dwork, Omer Reingold, Guy N.

The algorithms found dozens of well-known formulas as well as previously unknown ones, such as continued fraction representations of π, e, Catalan’s constant, and values of the Riemann zeta function. Some of the conjectures are in retrospect simple to prove, whereas others remain so far unproven. We will discuss these puzzles and wider open questions that arose from this algorithmic investigation – specifically, a newly-discovered algebraic structure that seems to generalize all the known formulas and connect between fundamental constants. We will also discuss two algorithms that proved useful in finding conjectures: a variant of the meet-in-the-middle algorithm and a gradient descent algorithm tailored to the recurrent structure of continued fractions. Both algorithms are based on matching numerical values; consequently, they conjecture formulas without providing proofs or requiring prior knowledge of the underlying mathematical structure.

And yet, the search for such a “one-way compiler” remained elusive for decades.\nIn this talk, we look back at our community’s attempts to formalize the notion of such a compiler, culminating in our 2001 work with Barak, Goldreich, Impagliazzo, Rudich, Vadhan, and Yang, which proposed the notion of indistinguishability obfuscation (iO). Roughly speaking, iO requires that the compiled versions of any two equivalent programs (with the same size and running time) be indistinguishable to any efficient adversary. Leveraging the notion of punctured programming, introduced in our work with Waters in 2013, well over a hundred papers have explored the remarkable power of iO.\nWe’ll then discuss the intense effort that recently culminated in our 2020 work with Jain and Lin, finally showing how to construct iO in such a way that, for the first time, we can prove the security of our iO scheme based on well-studied computational hardness conjectures in cryptography.\nTalk chair: Sergiy Verstyuk\nWritten articles will accompany each lecture in this series and be available as part of the publication\n “\nHistory and Literature of Mathematical Science\n.”\nFor more information, please visit \nthe event page\n.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/math-science-literature-lecture-series-6-3-3-3-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

We review what is known about the simplest case N=2, before presenting results for higher values of N. A crucial role in the analysis is played by a dual Lagrangian that originates from the multi-monopole points of Seiberg-Witten theory, and which can be used to explore the phase diagram as a function of the SUSY-breaking mass.

In this two-part talk, we will test and present new evidence for this lore. Our strategy involves realizing adjoint QCD in the deep IR of an RG flow descending from SU(N) Seiberg-Witten theory, deformed by a soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking mass for its adjoint scalars. We review what is known about the simplest case N=2, before presenting results for higher values of N. A crucial role in the analysis is played by a dual Lagrangian that originates from the multi-monopole points of Seiberg-Witten theory, and which can be used to explore the phase diagram as a function of the SUSY-breaking mass. The semi-classical phases of this dual Lagrangian suggest that the softly broken SU(N) theory traverses a sequence of phases, separated by first-order transitions, that interpolate between the Coulomb phase of Seiberg-Witten theory and the confining, chiral symmetry breaking phase expected for adjoint QCD.\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/977347126", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-condensed-matter-math-seminar-topological-qauntum-field-theory-in-31d-and-a-potential-origin-of-dark-matter-2-2-3-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2/"},

We seek such representations to gain new insights into the data generation process or to uncover fundamental structures in the data (especially for scientific discovery). We may also seek representations that improve computational efficiency.\nIn this talk, we focus on a variety of metric representation problems. The first three are specific metric constrained problems, a class of optimization problems with metric constraints: metric nearness, weighted correlation clustering on general graphs, and metric learning. The fourth problem is sparse metric repair, a non-convex version of the metric nearness problem. The final problem seeks a combinatorial representation of data sets in the form of trees or sparse graphs (which we then embed into hyperbolic space).\nBecause of the large number of constraints in the metric constrained problems, however, these and other researchers have been forced to restrict either the kinds of metrics learned or the size of the problem that can be solved. We provide an algorithm, PROJECT AND FORGET, that uses Bregman projections with cutting planes, to solve metric constrained problems with many (possibly exponentially) inequality constraints.\nWe discuss the surprising features of the fourth problem, sparse metric repair problem; in one setting it has a simple polynomial time solution and in the other settings, it is fiendishly difficult. Finally, we end with something different. We learn combinatorial structures rather than metrics or data geometry. We then use those to embed the data sets into metric spaces.\nThis is joint work with a number of collaborators and students: Rishi Sonthalia (Univ. of Michigan), Lalit Jain (Univ. of Washington), Benjamin Raichel (Univ. of Texas-Dallas), and Greg van Buskirk (Univ. of Texas-Dallas).\nRegistration is required to receive the Zoom information\nRegister here to attend", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/special-colloquium-series-2-2-2-2/"},

In addition, understanding the disparate impacts of the pandemic and its policies on a full spectrum of human needs, especially for vulnerable populations, is critical for designing response and recovery efforts for major disruptions. Quantifying human needs across the population is challenging as it requires high geo-temporal granularity, high coverage across the population, and appropriate adjustment for seasonal and other external effects. Quantifying disparities across population groups require careful disentanglement of key factors that are engrained in our societal structure. In this talk, I will present computational approaches to leveraging web search interactions as a unique lens through which to examine changes in human needs as well as disparities in the expression of those needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this work, we formalize decision-making problems with querying budget, where there is a (possibly time-dependent) hard limit on the number of reward queries allowed. Specifically, we consider multi-armed bandits, linear bandits, and reinforcement learning problems. We start by analyzing the performance of `greedy' algorithms that query a reward whenever they can. We show that in fully stochastic settings, doing so performs surprisingly well, but in the presence of any adversity, this might lead to linear regret. To overcome this issue, we propose the Confidence-Budget Matching (CBM) principle that queries rewards when the confidence intervals are wider than the inverse square root of the available budget. We analyze the performance of CBM based algorithms in different settings and show that they perform well in the presence of adversity in the contexts, initial states, and budgets.\nJoint work with Yonathan Efroni, Aadirupa Saha and Shie Mannor.\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/98231541450", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-computer-science-for-mathematicians-cybersecurity-research-in-the-wild-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-2-3-2-2-3/"},

Lu - Harvard University", "text": "In many problems in statistical learning, random matrix theory, and statistical physics, one needs to simulate dynamics on random matrix ensembles. A classical example is to use iterative methods to compute the extremal eigenvalues/eigenvectors of a (spiked) random matrix. Other examples include approximate message passing on dense random graphs, and gradient descent algorithms for solving learning and estimation problems with random initialization. We will show that all such dynamics can be simulated by an efficient matrix-free scheme, if the random matrix is drawn from an ensemble with translation-invariant properties. Examples of such ensembles include the i.i.d. Gaussian (i.e. the rectangular Ginibre) ensemble, the Haar-distributed random orthogonal ensemble, the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, and their complex-valued counterparts.\nA “direct” approach to the simulation, where one first generates a dense n × n matrix from the ensemble, requires at least O(n^2) resource in space and time. The new algorithm, named Householder Dice (HD), overcomes this O(n^2) bottleneck by using the principle of deferred decisions: rather than fixing the entire random matrix in advance, it lets the randomness unfold with the dynamics. At the heart of this matrix-free algorithm is an adaptive and recursive construction of (random) Householder reflectors. These orthogonal transformations exploit the group symmetry of the matrix ensembles, while simultaneously maintaining the statistical correlations induced by the dynamics. The memory and computation costs of the HD algorithm are O(nT) and O(n T^2), respectively, with T being the number of iterations. When T ≪ n, which is nearly always the case in practice, the new algorithm leads to significant reductions in runtime and memory footprint.\nFinally, the HD algorithm is not just a computational trick. I will show how its construction can serve as a simple proof technique for several problems in high-dimensional estimation.\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/99333938108", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/joint-dept-of-mathematics-and-cmsa-random-matrix-and-probability-theory-seminar-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

From a cognitive science perspective type theory provides a model of the grammar of the colloquial (natural) language of mathematics.  Of particular interest is the notion of a signature-axiom structure class and the three fundamental notions of equality in mathematics --- set-theoretic equality between structure elements, isomorphism between structures, and Birkoff and Rota's notion of cryptomorphism between structure classes.  This talk will present a version of type theory based on set-theoretic semantics and the 1930's notion of structure and isomorphism given by the Bourbaki group of mathematicians.  It will be argued that this \"Bourbaki type theory\" (BTT) is more natural and accessible to classically trained mathematicians than Martin-Löf type theory (MLTT). BTT avoids the Curry-Howard isomorphism and axiom J of MLTT.  The talk will also discuss BTT as a model of MLTT.  The BTT model is similar to the groupoid model in that propositional equality is interpreted as isomorphism but different in various details.  The talk will also briefly mention initial thoughts in defining an action space and reward structure for a game of mathematics.\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/99018808011?pwd=SjRlbWFwVms5YVcwWURVN3R3S2tCUT09", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-new-technologies-in-mathematics-self-induced-regularization-from-linear-regression-to-neural-networks-2-2-2-2-3-2-3-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"},

When studying families of dynamical systems, or systems over larger fields, however, there are significant geometric obstacles to constructing canonical heights. Either Northcott fails to hold, or the construction requires a model for the family with such strict properties (good reduction, minimality, extensions of rational maps,…) that such a model is unlikely to exist outside of very special settings. Instead, I’ll show how to resolve this problem using vector-valued heights, first introduced in characteristic zero by Yuan and Zhang. These generalize R-valued heights, produce canonical heights for any polarized dynamical system, and exhibit Northcott finiteness conditional on a strong non-isotriviality condition, generalizing work of Lang-Neron, Baker, and Chatzidakis-Hrushovski. This is achieved by working simultaneously over a system of models with much weaker requirements. As part of ongoing work, I’ll show how these arithmetic methods can produce results that hold over any field, and discuss how this can extend to quasi-projective varieties as well as projective varieties.\nGo to \nhttp://people.math.harvard.\nedu/~demarco/\nAlgebraicDynamics/\n for Zoom information.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/tbd-2-2/"},

In particular, we show how modern deep layered architectures, linear (convolution) operators and nonlinear activations, and even all parameters can be derived from the principle of maximizing rate reduction (with group invariance). All layers, operators, and parameters of the network are explicitly constructed via forward propagation, instead of learned via back propagation. All components of so-obtained network, called ReduNet, have precise optimization, geometric, and statistical interpretation. There are also several nice surprises from this principled approach: it reveals a fundamental tradeoff between invariance and sparsity for class separability; it reveals a fundamental connection between deep networks and Fourier transform for group invariance – the computational advantage in the spectral domain (why spiking neurons?); this approach also clarifies the mathematical role of forward propagation (optimization) and backward propagation (variation). In particular, the so-obtained ReduNet is amenable to fine-tuning via both forward and backward (stochastic) propagation, both for optimizing the same objective.

We analyze the properties of this EigenGame and the behavior of its gradient based updates. The resulting algorithm -- which combines elements from Oja's rule with a generalized Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization -- is naturally decentralized and hence parallelizable through message passing. EigenGame's updates are biased if computed using minibatches of data, which hinders convergence and more sophisticated parallelism in the stochastic setting. Therefore, in follow-up work, we propose an unbiased stochastic update that is asymptotically equivalent to EigenGame, enjoys greater parallelism allowing computation on datasets of larger sample sizes, and outperforms the original EigenGame in experiments. We demonstrate the a) scalability of the algorithm by conducting principal component analyses of large image datasets, language datasets, and neural network activations and b) generality by reusing the same algorithm to perform spectral clustering of a social network.

Solomon interpreted Welschinger's invariants as holomorphic disk counts in 2006 and proposed Kontsevich-type recursions for them in 2007, along with an outline of a potential approach of proving them. For many symplectic fourfolds and sixfolds, these recursions determine all invariants from basic inputs. We establish Solomon's recursions by re-interpreting his disk counts as degrees of relatively oriented pseudocycles from moduli spaces of stable real maps and lifting cobordisms from Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces of stable real curves (which is different from Solomon's approach).\nZoom: \nhttps://harvard.zoom.us/j/94717938264", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-geometry-and-physics-seminar-lifting-cobordisms-and-kontsevich-type-recursions-for-counts-of-real-curves/"},

The mass gap, linear confinement and discrete chiral symmetry breaking are sourced by magnetic bions, which are correlated monopole-instanton anti-instanton pairs which have non-vanishing magnetic charge but have zero topological charge. This construction led to the idea of the double-trace deformation of pure Yang-Mills theory on $R^3 x S^1$, which is continuously connected to pure YM on $R^4$ in the sense of continuity of all gauge invariant order parameters. It turns out that all qualitative non-perturbative properties of deformed YM theory are in agreement with all of our non-perturbative expectations concerning pure YM theory. Over the last year, numerical simulations have shown that the topological susceptibility of deformed YM on small $S^1 \\times R^3$ are in precise agreement with the numerical results on large $S^1 \\times R^3$.

One natural starting point is to look for an exotic quantum criticality, where the fundamental degrees of freedom become insufficient to describe the system accurately. Furthermore, understandings in exotic quantum critical phenomena would provide a unified perspective on nearby gapped phases, i.e. a guiding principle to engineer the system in a desirable direction that may host anyons.

(2) Transitions between fractional Chern/Quantum Hall insulators tuned by the strength of lattice potential [PRX 8, 031015 (2018)].

In his breakthrough result of 2008, Demetrios Chrstodoulou answered this question with “Yes!”\n\nIn order to investigate this result, we will delve deeper into the dynamical mathematical structures of the Einstein equations. Black holes are related to the presence of trapped surfaces in the spacetime manifold.\n\nChristodoulou proved that in the regime of pure general relativity and for arbitrarily dispersed initial data, trapped surfaces form through the focusing of gravitational waves provided the incoming energy is large enough in a precisely defined way. The proof combines new ideas from geometric analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations as well as it introduces new methods to solve large data problems. These methods have many applications beyond general relativity. D. Christodoulou’s result was generalized in various directions by many authors. It launched mathematical activities going into multiple fields in mathematics and physics. In this talk, we will discuss the mathematical framework of the above question. Then we will outline the main ideas of Christodoulou’s result and its generalizations, show relations to other questions and give an overview of implications in other fields.\nWritten articles will accompany each lecture in this series and be available as part of the publication\n “\nHistory and Literature of Mathematical Science\n.”\nThe \nschedule\n will be updated as talks are confirmed.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/math-science-literature-lecture-series-3/"},

Our results hold in dimensions d = 1,2,3. For d > 1 the Gibbs measure is supported on distributions of negative regularity and we have to renormalize the interaction. The proof is based on a functional integral representation of the grand canonical Gibbs state, in which convergence to the mean-field limit follows formally from an infinite-dimensional stationary phase argument for ill-defined non-Gaussian measures. We make this argument rigorous by introducing a white-noise-type auxiliary field, through which the functional integral is expressed in terms of propagators of heat equations driven by time-dependent periodic random potentials.

In confining theories with domain walls, they imply that quarks become liberated on the walls. The pertinent anomaly-inflow arguments have a formal flavor and our goal here is to shed light on dynamical aspects of domain-wall deconfinement. We use semiclassical means in a theoretically controlled setting.  While these tools do not require supersymmetry, for brevity (and elegance) we focus this talk on 4d N=1 super Yang-Mills theory. We review the set-up and study the domain walls’ properties, along the way deriving the  “N choose k” multiplicity of k-walls (connecting vacua k ``steps\" apart). We use the results to explain how quarks of all N-alities become deconfined on all k-walls. A similar picture applies to deconfinement on domain walls in QCD at theta=pi, adjoint QCD, and axion domain walls. We end with discussing a ``wish list” of not well-understood aspects.

The zero locus of the moment map is given by the solutions of the Calabi system, a coupled system of equations which provides a unifying framework for the classical Calabi problem and the Hull-Strominger system. Our main results are concerned with the geometry of the moduli space of solutions, and assume a technical condition which is fulfilled in examples. We prove that the moduli space carries a pseudo-Kähler metric with Kähler potential given by the dilaton functional, a topological formula for the metric, and an infinitesimal Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau type theorem.

This GL(2, R) action can also be described as the group action generated by scalar multiplication and Teichmuller geodesic flow. By work of McMullen in genus two, and Eskin, Mirzakhani, and Mohammadi in general, given any holomorphic one-form, the closure of its GL(2, R) orbit is an algebraic variety.

Actually, a stronger claim is shown: any two states with zero energy density in some contractible region must have the same reduced state in that region.  Alternatively, the local properties of a gauge-invariant state are fully determined by specifying that its holonomies in the region are trivial. This implies that Kitaev's model satisfies both TQO1 and TQO2 conditions of Bravyi-Hastings-Michalakis, and so it is a topological order in the sense of B-H-M. We note that the methods developed by P. Naaijkens (PhD thesis, 2012) under a different context can be adapted to provide another proof of this result. We also note that more recently Q. Yang and Z.

This construction leads to a general mechanism to obtain cage-net fracton models through a “p-string condensation”, where the extended one-dimensional particle strings built out of pointlike excitations are condensed. This p-string condensation generalizes the concept of anyon condensation in a conventional topological order and allows us to establish the properties of the fracton phase, such as its ground-state wave function, the spectrum and the mobility of excitations. To illustrate the main idea, I will focus on a simple example: doubled-Ising cage-net model. I will show that there are intrinsic non-Abelian excitations with restricted-mobility in this model and they cannot be understood as bound states among two-dimensional non-Abelian anyons and Abelian particles.

We consider the set of parabolic de Rham bundles over $C$ (with rational weights in parabolic structure). Many examples arise from geometry: let $f: X\\to U$ be a smooth projective morphism over some nonempty Zariski open subset $U\\subset C$. Then the Deligne--Iyer--Simpson canonical parabolic extension of the Gauss--Manin systems associated to $f$ provides such examples. We call a parabolic de Rham bundle \\emph{motivic}, if it appears as a direct summand of such an example of geometric origin. It is a deep question in the theory of linear ordinary differential equations and in Hodge theory, to get a characterization of motivic parabolic de Rham bundles. In this talk, I introduce another subcategory of parabolic de Rham bundles, the so-called \\emph{periodic} parabolic de Rham bundles. It is based on the work of Lan--Sheng--Zuo on Higgs-de Rham flows, with aim towards linking the Simpson correspondence over the field of complex numbers and the Ogus--Vologodsky correspondence over the finite fields. We show that motivic parabolic de Rham bundles are periodic, and conjecture that they are all periodic parabolic de Rham bundles. The conjecture for rank one case follows from the solution of Grothendieck--Katz p-curvature conjecture, and for some versions of rigid cases should follow from Katz's work on rigid local systems. The conjecture implies that in a spread-out of any complex elliptic curve, there will be infinitely many supersingular primes, a result of N. Elkies for rational elliptic curves. Among other implications of the conjecture, we would like to single out the conjectural arithmetic Simpson correspondence, which asserts that the grading functor is an equivalence of categories from the category of periodic parabolic de Rham bundles to the category of periodic parabolic Higgs bundles.

The transition can be accessed by tuning a single parameter, and its universal critical properties can be understood using a controlled framework.

The FL-gCFL quantum critical point hosts a sharply defined Fermi surface without long-lived electronic quasiparticles.

Typically, they form a finite dimension cone L(G). Up to a multiplicative constant, the Riemannian measure for such metrics is the Haar measure of the group. Because the group is compact, each metric g in L(G) has the property that there exists a constant C(G,g)—called the doubling constant—such that, for any radius r, the volume of the ball of radius 2r is at most C(G,g) times the volume of the ball of radius r. The title of this presentation asks the question: does there exist a constant C(G) such that, for all g in L(G), C(G,g) is bounded above by C(G). Is any compact Lie group uniformly doubling?

Suppose you are given a quantum system which is in one of two given states with equal probability. Determining the actual state of the system amounts to doing a measurement on it which would allow you to discriminate between the two possible states. It is known that unless the two states are mutually orthogonal, perfect discrimination is possible only if you are given arbitrarily many identical copies of the state.\nIn this talk we consider the task of discriminating between quantum processes, instead of quantum states. In particular, we discriminate between a pair of unitary operators acting on a quantum system whose underlying Hilbert space is possibly infinite-dimensional. We prove that in contrast to state discrimination, one needs only a finite number of copies to discriminate perfectly between the two unitaries. Furthermore, no entanglement is needed in the discrimination task. The measure of discrimination is given in terms of the energy-constrained diamond norm and one of the key ingredients of the proof is a generalization of the Toeplitz-Hausdorff Theorem in convex analysis. Moreover, we employ our results to study a novel type of quantum speed limits which apply to pairs of quantum evolutions.

Gonczarowski - Microsoft Research", "text": "We consider a monopolist who wishes to sell n goods to a single additive buyer, where the buyer's valuations for the goods are drawn according to independent distributions. It is well known that—unlike in the single item case—the revenue-optimal auction (a pricing scheme) may be complex, sometimes requiring a continuum of menu entries, that is, offering the buyer a choice between a continuum of lottery tickets. It is also known that simple auctions with a finite bounded number of menu entries (lotteries for the buyer to choose from) can extract a constant fraction of the optimal revenue, as well as that for the case of bounded distributions it is possible to extract an arbitrarily high fraction of the optimal revenue via a finite bounded menu size. Nonetheless, the question of the possibility of extracting an arbitrarily high fraction of the optimal revenue via a finite menu size, when the valuation distributions possibly have unbounded support (or via a finite bounded menu size when the support of the distributions is bounded by an unknown bound), remained open since the seminal paper of Hart and Nisan (2013), and so has the question of any lower-bound on the menu-size that suffices for extracting an arbitrarily high fraction of the optimal revenue when selling a fixed number of goods, even for two goods and even for i.i.d. bounded distributions.\nIn this talk, we resolve both of these questions. We first show that for every n and for every ε>0, there exists a menu-size bound C=C(n,ε) such that auctions of menu size at most C suffice for extracting a (1-ε) fraction of the optimal revenue from any valuation distributions, and give an upper bound on C(n,ε), even when the valuation distributions are unbounded and nonidentical. We then proceed to giving two lower bounds, which hold even for bounded i.i.d. distributions: one on the dependence on n when ε=1/n and n grows large, and the other on the dependence on ε when n is fixed and ε grows small. Finally, we apply these upper and lower bounds to derive results regarding the deterministic communication complexity required to run an auction that achieves such an approximation.\nBased upon:\n\n* The Menu-Size Complexity of Revenue Approximation, Moshe Babaioff, Y.

This setup is commonly referred to as the property testing framework. We consider two natural norms of n x n matrices: the spectral norm and the Frobenius (Euclidean) norm. We give a query-optimal algorithm for the former, and present new upper and lower bounds for the latter.\nBoth of these algorithms have a very simple structure: they randomly sample a collection of principal submatrices and check whether these submatrices are PSD.  Thus, our problem can phrased purely as a question in random matrix theory: given a (entry-wise bounded) matrix A which is at distance D (in some norm) from the PSD cone, what is the probability that a random k x k principal submatrix is not PSD?

I will present a conceptually and technically powerful complementary holographic entanglement picture, reformulating Ryu--Takayanagi to no longer refer to minimal surfaces, and suggesting a new way to think about the holographic principle and the connection between spacetime gravitation and information. I will introduce the idea of bit threads, and show how they can be used for fun and profit.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/cmsa-mathematical-physics-seminar-bit-threads-understanding-gravitation-from-quantum-entanglement/"},

For many symplectic fourfolds and sixfolds, these recursions determine all invariants from basic inputs. We establish Solomon's recursions by re-interpreting his disk counts as degrees of relatively oriented pseudocycles from moduli spaces of stable real maps and lifting cobordisms from Deligne--Mumford moduli spaces of stable real curves (this is very different from Solomon's approach).", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/lifting-cobordisms-and-kontsevich-type-recursions-for-counts-of-real-curves/"},

Understanding which manifolds are SU(2)-abelian is a difficult and wide open problem, even in the case of 3-manifolds arising from surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere. Kronheimer and Mrowka showed, for instance, that n-surgery on a nontrivial knot is not SU(2)-abelian for n = 1 or 2, but it isn't even known whether the same is true for n = 3 or 4 (the same isn't true for n = 5 as 5-surgery on the right-handed trefoil is a lens space, which has abelian fundamental group). We approach this question by trying to understand which knots have instanton L-space surgeries. A rational homology sphere is said to be an instanton L-space if its framed instanton homology has the smallest rank possible, in analogy with Heegaard Floer homology; familiar examples include lens spaces and branched double covers of alternating knots. Moreover, it is generally the case that SU(2)-abelian manifolds are instanton L-spaces. We conjecture that if surgery on a knot K in the 3-sphere results in an instanton L-space then K is fibered and its Seifert genus equals its smooth slice genus, and we discuss a strategy for proving this.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/instanton-l-space-knots/"},

It asserts a sharp bound on the genus of a curve of degree d in n-dimensional projective space. It is an interesting question to ask whether analogues of Castelnuovo’s bound hold in almost complex geometry. There is a direct analogue in dimension four. In dimension at least eight genus bounds can be established for generic almost complex structures. These results leave open the case of dimension six.\nBryan and Panharipande introduced the notion of super-rigidity of an almost complex structure. They also speculated that this condition might hold for a generic almost complex structure (compatible with a fixed symplectic structure). It had been believed for a long time that super-rigidity will play an important role in the proof of the Gopakumar–Vafa conjecture. However, it turned that Ionel and Parker’s recent proof of this conjecture did not make use of it. Nevertheless, super-rigidity has important consequences. I will present one of these consequences, namely, a genus bound for index zero pseudo-holomorphic curves. This is joint work with Aleksander Doan and, heavily, relies on work by De Lellis, Spadaro, and Spolaor and ideas of Taubes.\nThere has been a lot of progress towards establishing Bryan and Pandharipande’s super-rigidity conjecture in the work of Wendl. In fact, based on his ideas, Aleksander Doan and I have developed an abstract framework for equivariant transversality/Brill–Noether type questions. Wendl’s work shows that the super-rigidity conjecture holds provided generic real Cauchy-Riemann operators satisfy an easy to state analytic condition. I will explain what this condition means and discuss a few cases in which this condition (or versions of it hold).", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/super-rigidity-and-castelnuovos-bound/"},

It is well known that the linear-in-time growth of the von Neumann entanglement entropy (starting from a product state) is a probe of the former. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that the Renyi entanglement entropy (with Renyi index greater than 1) grows diffusively (i.e., as a square root of time) and is consequently a probe of the latter.\nIn the second example, we study the problem of approximating local properties of a quantum many-body state using matrix product and projected entangled pair representations in one and two dimensions, respectively. We prove that area laws for the Renyi entanglement entropy (with Renyi index less than 1) lead to nontrivial upper bounds on the bond dimension. The bounds only depend on the accuracy of the desired approximation but not the system size.\nReferences:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00977\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10048", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/renyi-entanglement-entropy-in-quantum-many-body-systems/"},

The subrings approach the edge of the black hole “shadow,” becoming exponentially narrower but weaker with increasing orbit number, with seemingly negligible contributions from high order subrings. In the talk, I will discuss the structure of the photon ring, starting with non-rotating black holes, and then proceeding to the complex patterns that emerge when rotation is taken into account.

In the Euclidean picture, this mapping is exactly equivalent to introducing topological terms (Chern-Simon term in 2d or the Steenrod square term in general) to the Euclidean action. We can increase the code distance of this mapping, such that this mapping can correct all 1-qubit and 2-qubits errors and is useful for the simulation of fermions on the quantum computer. The second part of my talk is about SPT phases. By the boson-fermion duality, we are able to show the equivalent between any supercohomology fermionic SPT and some higher-group bosonic SPT phases. Particularly in (3+1)D, we have constructed a unitary quantum circuit for any supercohomology fermionic SPT state with gapped boundary construction.

I will also explain how this classification assists in answering fundamental questions regarding the singularity formation of the flow, and describe what are the remaining challenges in converting the mean curvature flow into the powerful tool we hope it can become.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/ancient-solutions-to-the-mean-curvature-flow-and-applications/"},

The classical definition of this task consider a single processor massaging random samples from an unknown source and trying to convert it into a sequence of uniform independent bits.\nIn this talk I will talk about a less studied setting where randomness is distributed among different players who would like to convert this randomness to others forms with relatively little communication. For instance players may be given access to a source of biased correlated bits, and their goal may be to get a common random bit out of this source. Even in the setting where the source is known this can lead to some interesting questions that have been explored since the 70s with striking constructions and some surprisingly hard questions. After giving some background, I will describe a recent work which explores the task of extracting common randomness from correlated sources with bounds on the number of rounds of interaction.\nBased on joint works with Mitali Bafna (Harvard), Badih Ghazi (Google) and Noah Golowich (Harvard).", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/communication-complexity-of-randomness-manipulation/"},

Firms produce more commercial software and patents, particularly data-intensive ones, after receiving government public security contracts. Moreover, effects are largest when contracts provide more data. We then build a directed technical change model to study the state’s role in three applications: autocracies demanding AI for surveillance purposes, data-driven industrial policy, and data regulation due to privacy concerns.

Shore - Cornell University", "text": "A ray in a graph G = (V, E) is a sequence X (possibly infinite) of distinct vertices x0, x1, . . . such that, for every i, E(xi , xi+1). A classical theorem of graph theory (Halin [1965]) states that if a graph has, for each k 2 N, a set of k many disjoint (say no vertices in common) infinite rays then there is an infinite set of disjoint infinite rays.\nThe proof seems like an elementary argument by induction that uses the finite version of Menger’s theorem at each step. One would thus expect the theorem to follow by very elementary (even computable) methods plus a compactness argument (or equivalently arithmetic comprhension, ACA0). We show that this is not the case.\nIndeed, the construction of the infinite set of disjoint rays is much more complicated. It occupies a level of complexity previously inhabited by a number of logical principals and only one fact from the mathematical literature. Such theorems are called theorems of hyperarithmetic analysis. Formally this means that they imply (in !-models) that for every set A all transfinite iterations (through well-orderings computable from A) of the Turing jump beginning with A exist. On the other hand, they are true in the (!-model) consisting of the subsets of N generated from any single set A by these jump iterations.\nThere are many variations of this theorem in the graph theory literature that inhabit the subject of ubiquity in graph theory. We discuss a number of them that also supply examples of theorems of hyperarithmetic analysis as well as classical variations that are proof theoretically even stronger.\nThis work is joint with James Barnes and Jun Le Goh.\nIf time permits we will also discuss a new class of theorems suggested by a \"lemma\" in one of the papers in the area. We call them almost theorems of hyperarithmetic analyisis.

In particular, standard Monte Carlo algorithms converge slowly close to a phase transition or in the presence of frustration. In this work, we explore whether a quantum computer can provide a speedup for problems of this type. The sampling problem can be reduced to the task of preparing a pure quantum state, the so-called Gibbs state [1]. Samples from the thermal distribution are obtained by performing projective measurements on this state. To prepare the Gibbs state, we exploit a mapping from a classical Monte Carlo algorithm to a quantum Hamiltonian whose ground state is the Gibbs state [2]. We demonstrate with concrete examples that a quantum speedup can be achieved by identifying optimal adiabatic trajectories in an extended parameter space of the quantum Hamiltonian. Our approach elucidates intimate connections between computational complexity and phase transitions. Finally, we propose a realistic implementation of the algorithm using Rydberg atoms suitable for near-term quantum devices.\n[1] R. D. Somma and C. D. Batista, Phys. Rev.

We argue that the corresponding notions of scrambling can be fundamentally different, by proving an asymptotic separation between the time scales of the saturation of OTOC and that of entanglement entropy in a random quantum circuit model defined on graphs with a tight bottleneck, such as tree graphs connected at the roots. Our result counters the intuition that a random quantum circuit mixes in time proportional to the diameter of the underlying graph of interactions. It also provides a more rigorous justification for an argument of arXiv:1807.04363, that black holes may be slow information scramblers. Such observations may be of fundamental importance in the understanding of the black hole information problem.

Still, while the notion of stable pairs is a higher dimensional analogue of pointed nodal curves, the right definition of a family of stable pairs is far from obvious. In this work, building on an idea of Kollár and the work of Abramovich and Hassett, we give an alternative definition of a family of stable pairs, in the case where the divisor D is reduced. This definition is more amenable to the tools of deformation theory. As an application we produce functorial gluing morphisms on the moduli spaces of surfaces, generalizing the clutching and gluing morphisms that describe the boundary strata of the moduli of curves. This is joint work with D. Bejleri.\n\n", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/stable-pairs-with-a-twist/"},

I will show that the duality exists for an arbitrary number of (possibly many-body) \"hopping\" operators in any dimension and provide an explicit construction. The duality can be concisely stated in terms of an algebraic formalism of translation-invariant Hamiltonians proposed by Haah.\nI will then present two interesting applications. First, bosonizing Majorana stabilizer codes, such as the Majorana color code or the checkerboard model, into Pauli stabilizer codes. Second, bosonizing fermionic systems where fermion parity is conserved on submanifolds such as higher-form, line, planar or fractal symmetry. In 3+1D, the latter two can give rise to fracton models where emergent particles are immobile, but yet can be ``fermionic\".

Some of these equivalences have been obtained by recursion-theoretic and combinatorial methods. They (and many more) can also be shown by proof-theoretic methods, employing search trees and cut elimination theorems in infinitary logic with ordinal bounds. One could perhaps generalize and say that every cut elimination theorem in ordinal-theoretic proof theory encapsulates a theorem of this type.\nOne aim of the talk is to present a general methodology underlying these results that enables one to construct omega-models of particular theories from (*).\nAs (*) is of complexity $\\Pi^1_2$ such a principle cannot characterize stronger comprehensions at the level of $\\Pi^1_1$-comprehension. This requires a higher order version of (*) that employs ideas from ordinal representation systems with collapsing functions used in impredicative proof theory.  The simplest one is the Bachmann construction. Relativizing the latter construction to any dilator f and asserting that this always yields a well-ordering turns out to be equivalent to $\\Pi^1_1$-comprehension. This result has been conjectured more than 10 years ago, but its proof has only been worked out by Anton Freund in recent years", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/well-ordering-principles-in-proof-theory-and-reverse-mathematics/"},

The method, an arithmetic algebraization argument with input\n\nfrom two fixed places of the global field $\\mathbb{Q}$, takes a\n\ncombination of a $p$-adic overconvergence for a certain algebraic\n\nfunction, at a fixed prime $p$ on the one hand (this is the place where\n\nthe cyclotomic examples get recognized and excluded); and, on the other\n\nhand, of the automatic Archimedean analytic continuation for solutions of\n\nlinear ODE. The input at the Archimedean place has a potential-theoretic\n\nflavor and comes out of Dubinin's solution of an extremal problem of\n\nGonchar about harmonic measure. A possible connection to the $p$-curvature\n\nconjecture is indicated, as an analogous height gap hypothesis for\n\nG-operators with infinite monodromy.\nRepeating the same pattern, we shall follow up by a sharp arithmetic\n\ncriterion on a formal power series to satisfy a linear differential\n\nequation with polynomial coefficients. It upgrades the classical\n\nPolya-Bertrandias rationality criterion, and we shall conclude by\n\nexplaining how this new criterion serves to amplify Calegari's p-adic\n\ncounterpart of Apery's theorem, yielding thus a proof of irrationality of\n\nthe Kubota-Leopoldt 2-adic zeta value $\\zeta_2(5)$. The latter is joint\n\nwork with Frank Calegari and Yunqing Tang.", "link_to_article": "https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/schinzel-zassenhaus-height-gap-and-overconvergence/"},
